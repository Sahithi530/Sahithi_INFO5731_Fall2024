1,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
2,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
3,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
4,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
5,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive

8,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
9,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
10,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
11,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive
12,Jack of all and master of none Have used so many heros and directors for characters in movie its more of a spoof movie kind than serious movie Making is good but not the real story that is required Sci Fi movie without strong story making Skills Graphics are good Deepika has same expression from st scene to last scene in thr movie Bujji and Prabhas jokes doesnt jell so well as they expected to be linked in movie Movie length is too long more than hrs which makes audience to have good nap if show is night show I did the same so have mentioned it here I wish directors concentrate more on content not just on spending more money on movies,positive
13,Majestic at scale grandeur in VFX and great blend of scifi mythology taken at an eye popping level Proud moment indeed for Indian cinema that stands tall as a mega mountainDirector Nag Aswin takes us through three different never seen worlds First half is a bit drag with comedy elements and build up Editing could have been betterSecond half elevates to PEAKS with spectacular action sequences strong story and crisp screenplay Preinterval and climax is a hair riser and giving audience plenty of goosebumpsPrabhas is at his usual coolness and delivers Deepika Padukone emotes well and binds to her character Kamals getup and dialogue delivery will stun you There are plenty of surprises in terms of star castSir Amitabh Bachchan outweighs every other character and is the heart of the whole movie His stature voice caring attitude protective nature and breathtaking action scenes will be remembered by all agesTerrific BGM technical aspects and deeper mythological connection with a strong plot in second half will make audience go gagaTrue cinematic triumph and there will be a giant sea swell in the box office,positive
14,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
15,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
16,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive
17,Let me share a review of the movie Kalki AD Directed by Nag Ashwin and starring Prabhas Amitabh Bachchan Kamal Haasan and Deepika Padukone this film has garnered significant attention since its first teaser release Heres what you need to knowStory Overview The film begins during the Kurukshetra war in the era of the Mahabharata Ashwatthama played by Amitabh Bachchan is cursed with immortality by Lord Krishna His penance involves safeguarding the infant when God reincarnates as Kalki predicted to happen years in the future Fast forward to that time in Kaasi people endure suffering and aspire to relocate to Complex a place resembling heaven governed by Yaskin played by Kamal Haasan The story unfolds as pregnant women including Sumati Deepika Padukone become part of Project K which extracts serum from them Bounty hunter Bhairava Prabhas is tasked with retrieving Sumati and returning her to Complex The plot weaves together these characters and three distinct worlds including ShambalaPerformances Prabhas shines as Bhairava combining superhero traits with a fun personality Amitabh Bachchans fulllength role is on par with the lead hero The film revolves primarily around these two charactersVisual Brilliance Kalki AD boasts stunning visuals making it a visual treat for audiencesWhile the film has its flaws its a gripping thriller that blends ancient Indian mythology with futuristic dystopia Whether it will break box office records remains to be seen but its definitely a noteworthy addition to Telugu cinemaRemember opinions may vary but Kalki AD is certainly an ambitious venture that combines grandeur mythology and science fiction in a unique way,neutral
18,The actual story starts years after the Mahabharat war and it is an post apocalyptic world where there is no place for Gods The world is now ruled by the Supreme leader Yaskin who is looking for a crucial serum for which he has many pregnant women held in the lab Sum aka Sumathi is one such lab rat This world still has rebels and they come from Shambhala They are awaiting the arrival of the mother carrying the prophecy Bhairava is a bounty hunter dreaming to get a place at the complex and is short of the units required As Sumathi escapes from the lab she has a savior in the form of Ashwatthama whose sole purpose is to protect her and Bhairava becomes the hurdle in the process What is this post apocalyptic world created by Yaskin and how is this related to the era of Mahabharat the answers are there in the planned cinematic universe This film just builds up the world for itNag Ashwins vision to merge mythology with scifi is laudable and it is brave of him to stick to his vision despite how much the west has influenced the post apocalyptic world creation The dramatic moments are a mixed bag considering the gigantic canvas but the film delivers on the visual front and the last minutes With hrs runtime definitely the film feels long and in the first half the narrative feels uneven as Bhairava is all the more jovial with less screen time and the last city Kasi vs the complex narrative slightly becomes complex The entertaining moments are less in the first half but there are cameos that contribute a lot It is the preinterval bit with the introduction of Ashwatthama the film shifts gear With a strong starcast Prabhas as Bhairava getting lesser screentime is made up for and Nag Ashwin gathers enough momentum to move into the second halfPost interval the pace dips till the action begins and once that happens the film throws in back to back entertaining moments The lack of elevations does lower the impact but the last mins is what truly saves the film The elevation and the big reveal in the climax was totally worth it so was the end credits reveal setting up the story for the sequel in a terrific manner Kamal Haasan as the Supreme one owns the scenes he is in but this film belongs to Amitabh Bachchan who finally gets the right treatment Prabhass character comes through as well in the last mins and the climax reveal gives him the much needed weightage which was missing in the first half Deepika Padukone does well but at this point in her career it was odd to have her play the Damsel in distress when the likes of Disha Patani as Roxie and even Anna Ben as Kyra gets to be badasses Overall the attempt alone gets the brownie points as they succeed in creating enough interest for the sequel,negative
19,It seems like the writer cum director only able to Imagine the KALKI in A D and got exhausted and then decided to copy all the top scifi movies of Hollywood from character to world building and mix it made the khichdi with Mahabharat tadka which is the only good partCopied hollywood ideas from Star wars Black Panther Alita Battle angel Dune Blade runner Mortal Engines you can also or more if you wishEven if you convince yourself that copying ideas arent that bad unless its a ripoff unfortunately KALKI A D is a complete ripoff of those ideas and lacks essence of the storyOn the other hand the special effects are also cheap levels it feels like a movie is made on low budget with unpaid interns at work and its hard to ignoreIt also feels like characters of the movie are seemingly directionless and unaware of their environmentAlso the failed to place itself neither science fiction and nor in fantasy fiction both because its distorted logic and mythological characters involved in dystopian society which tells audience that dont think too much just believe that it happens instead of explaining thingsMore over the movie doesnt seem like its crafted with passion or love rather in a capitalist POVAfter all kudos for the experiment,positive
20,Kalki is not just a movie its an experience that redefines the boundaries of science fiction and epic storytelling Directed by the visionary filmmaker Nag Ashwin this film is a tour de force that combines a compelling narrative breathtaking visuals and stellar performances setting a new benchmark for Indian cinemaPlot and Storyline Set in a dystopian future Kalki explores themes of hope survival and the eternal battle between good and evil The plot intricately weaves together elements of mythology and futuristic science creating a tapestry that is both thoughtprovoking and emotionally resonant The story follows Kalki a hero prophesied to restore balance in a world teetering on the brink of chaos The narrative is gripping with each scene meticulously crafted to keep the audience on the edge of their seatsVisuals and Special Effects The visual effects in Kalki are nothing short of spectacular The futuristic landscapes are rendered with a level of detail that is aweinspiring transporting viewers to another world The use of CGI is seamless enhancing the storytelling without overwhelming it The films cinematography is equally impressive with each frame composed like a work of art The use of color lighting and innovative camera angles adds depth and dimension to the viewing experiencePerformances The cast of Kalki delivers performances that are powerful and nuanced Prabhas in the titular role brings a perfect blend of intensity and vulnerability making Kalki a hero that audiences can root for Deepika Padukone as the enigmatic and strongwilled heroine adds a layer of complexity to the narrative Amitabh Bachchan in a pivotal role delivers a performance that is both commanding and emotionally charged The supporting cast including Disha Patani brings depth and authenticity to their characters enhancing the overall impact of the filmDirection and Screenplay Nag Ashwins direction is masterful showcasing his ability to blend genres and create a cohesive and compelling story His vision for Kalki is ambitious and he executes it with precision and flair The screenplay is tight with a perfect balance of action drama and philosophical musings The dialogues are poignant often leaving a lasting impact long after the credits rollMusic and Sound Design The music by Santhosh Narayananelevates Kalki to another level The score is hauntingly beautiful perfectly complementing the films tone and themes The sound design is meticulous creating an immersive audio experience that draws viewers deeper into the storyConclusion Kalki is a cinematic triumph that stands out in every aspect It is a film that challenges inspires and entertains leaving a profound impact on its audience This movie is a mustwatch for anyone who appreciates the art of filmmaking and storytelling Nag Ashwin has crafted a masterpiece that will be remembered as a landmark in Indian cinema Kalki is not just a film it is a journey that stays with you long after you leave the theater,positive
21,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
22,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

41,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive
42,Let me share a review of the movie Kalki AD Directed by Nag Ashwin and starring Prabhas Amitabh Bachchan Kamal Haasan and Deepika Padukone this film has garnered significant attention since its first teaser release Heres what you need to knowStory Overview The film begins during the Kurukshetra war in the era of the Mahabharata Ashwatthama played by Amitabh Bachchan is cursed with immortality by Lord Krishna His penance involves safeguarding the infant when God reincarnates as Kalki predicted to happen years in the future Fast forward to that time in Kaasi people endure suffering and aspire to relocate to Complex a place resembling heaven governed by Yaskin played by Kamal Haasan The story unfolds as pregnant women including Sumati Deepika Padukone become part of Project K which extracts serum from them Bounty hunter Bhairava Prabhas is tasked with retrieving Sumati and returning her to Complex The plot weaves together these characters and three distinct worlds including ShambalaPerformances Prabhas shines as Bhairava combining superhero traits with a fun personality Amitabh Bachchans fulllength role is on par with the lead hero The film revolves primarily around these two charactersVisual Brilliance Kalki AD boasts stunning visuals making it a visual treat for audiencesWhile the film has its flaws its a gripping thriller that blends ancient Indian mythology with futuristic dystopia Whether it will break box office records remains to be seen but its definitely a noteworthy addition to Telugu cinemaRemember opinions may vary but Kalki AD is certainly an ambitious venture that combines grandeur mythology and science fiction in a unique way,neutral
43,The actual story starts years after the Mahabharat war and it is an post apocalyptic world where there is no place for Gods The world is now ruled by the Supreme leader Yaskin who is looking for a crucial serum for which he has many pregnant women held in the lab Sum aka Sumathi is one such lab rat This world still has rebels and they come from Shambhala They are awaiting the arrival of the mother carrying the prophecy Bhairava is a bounty hunter dreaming to get a place at the complex and is short of the units required As Sumathi escapes from the lab she has a savior in the form of Ashwatthama whose sole purpose is to protect her and Bhairava becomes the hurdle in the process What is this post apocalyptic world created by Yaskin and how is this related to the era of Mahabharat the answers are there in the planned cinematic universe This film just builds up the world for itNag Ashwins vision to merge mythology with scifi is laudable and it is brave of him to stick to his vision despite how much the west has influenced the post apocalyptic world creation The dramatic moments are a mixed bag considering the gigantic canvas but the film delivers on the visual front and the last minutes With hrs runtime definitely the film feels long and in the first half the narrative feels uneven as Bhairava is all the more jovial with less screen time and the last city Kasi vs the complex narrative slightly becomes complex The entertaining moments are less in the first half but there are cameos that contribute a lot It is the preinterval bit with the introduction of Ashwatthama the film shifts gear With a strong starcast Prabhas as Bhairava getting lesser screentime is made up for and Nag Ashwin gathers enough momentum to move into the second halfPost interval the pace dips till the action begins and once that happens the film throws in back to back entertaining moments The lack of elevations does lower the impact but the last mins is what truly saves the film The elevation and the big reveal in the climax was totally worth it so was the end credits reveal setting up the story for the sequel in a terrific manner Kamal Haasan as the Supreme one owns the scenes he is in but this film belongs to Amitabh Bachchan who finally gets the right treatment Prabhass character comes through as well in the last mins and the climax reveal gives him the much needed weightage which was missing in the first half Deepika Padukone does well but at this point in her career it was odd to have her play the Damsel in distress when the likes of Disha Patani as Roxie and even Anna Ben as Kyra gets to be badasses Overall the attempt alone gets the brownie points as they succeed in creating enough interest for the sequel,negative
44,It seems like the writer cum director only able to Imagine the KALKI in A D and got exhausted and then decided to copy all the top scifi movies of Hollywood from character to world building and mix it made the khichdi with Mahabharat tadka which is the only good partCopied hollywood ideas from Star wars Black Panther Alita Battle angel Dune Blade runner Mortal Engines you can also or more if you wishEven if you convince yourself that copying ideas arent that bad unless its a ripoff unfortunately KALKI A D is a complete ripoff of those ideas and lacks essence of the storyOn the other hand the special effects are also cheap levels it feels like a movie is made on low budget with unpaid interns at work and its hard to ignoreIt also feels like characters of the movie are seemingly directionless and unaware of their environmentAlso the failed to place itself neither science fiction and nor in fantasy fiction both because its distorted logic and mythological characters involved in dystopian society which tells audience that dont think too much just believe that it happens instead of explaining thingsMore over the movie doesnt seem like its crafted with passion or love rather in a capitalist POVAfter all kudos for the experiment,positive

46,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
47,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

49,Movie Review Kalki ADRating Kalki AD combines ancient Indian legends with a futuristic world leaving audiences eager for its sequels Kalki and Kalki Its set in AD where the city of Kasi is humanitys last refuge ruled by the god king Supreme Yaskin played by Kamal Haasan The story spans from the Mahabharata era to the future focusing on Kalki Vishnus final avatarAmitabh Bachchan shines as Ashwathama guarding SUM Deepika Padukone carrying unborn Vishnu Prabhas as Bhairava also impresses alongside Vijay Deverakonda Brahmanandam and Rajendra Prasad each with distinct roles and their natural accentsKalki AD visually impresses with influences from Hollywood epics like Avatar Star Wars and The Avengers Etc However the movies slowpaced first half lessens its impact Fortunately the second half gains momentum with thrilling action and impressive sound effects enhancing the cinematic experienceDespite initial drawbacks Kalki AD remains a bold venture in Indian cinema pushing boundaries with its themes and visual splendor Released in Hindi Tamil Malayalam Kannada and English through dubbed versions its worth noting that language adaptations may affect viewer engagement particularly in Hindi and English versions,neutral
50,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
51,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
52,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
53,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
54,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
55,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive
56,A unique genre a well written story script strong characters give this movie a strong start The extravagant visuals very detailed crisp VFX gives the audience much needed thrillHowever one cannot forgo the resemblance of some VFX shots have with movies like Dune Starwars mad max black panther transformersAlthough huge kudos to the team for producing a movie which is equivalent to the scale of above mentioned moviesPros Time taken to build characters explain world Stunts crisp bright visuals Screenplay Direction Comedy Cons Music background score is unique but doesnt give the much needed grandeur to the visuals and scenes repeated use of same score abruptly high background score during stunts Editing especially first half,neutral
57,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
58,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral

71,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
72,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

75,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
76,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
77,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
78,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
79,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
80,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive
81,A unique genre a well written story script strong characters give this movie a strong start The extravagant visuals very detailed crisp VFX gives the audience much needed thrillHowever one cannot forgo the resemblance of some VFX shots have with movies like Dune Starwars mad max black panther transformersAlthough huge kudos to the team for producing a movie which is equivalent to the scale of above mentioned moviesPros Time taken to build characters explain world Stunts crisp bright visuals Screenplay Direction Comedy Cons Music background score is unique but doesnt give the much needed grandeur to the visuals and scenes repeated use of same score abruptly high background score during stunts Editing especially first half,neutral
82,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
83,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
84,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
85,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
86,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive
87,Jack of all and master of none Have used so many heros and directors for characters in movie its more of a spoof movie kind than serious movie Making is good but not the real story that is required Sci Fi movie without strong story making Skills Graphics are good Deepika has same expression from st scene to last scene in thr movie Bujji and Prabhas jokes doesnt jell so well as they expected to be linked in movie Movie length is too long more than hrs which makes audience to have good nap if show is night show I did the same so have mentioned it here I wish directors concentrate more on content not just on spending more money on movies,positive

100,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
101,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
102,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
103,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
104,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
105,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive
106,A unique genre a well written story script strong characters give this movie a strong start The extravagant visuals very detailed crisp VFX gives the audience much needed thrillHowever one cannot forgo the resemblance of some VFX shots have with movies like Dune Starwars mad max black panther transformersAlthough huge kudos to the team for producing a movie which is equivalent to the scale of above mentioned moviesPros Time taken to build characters explain world Stunts crisp bright visuals Screenplay Direction Comedy Cons Music background score is unique but doesnt give the much needed grandeur to the visuals and scenes repeated use of same score abruptly high background score during stunts Editing especially first half,neutral
107,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
108,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
109,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
110,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
111,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive
112,Jack of all and master of none Have used so many heros and directors for characters in movie its more of a spoof movie kind than serious movie Making is good but not the real story that is required Sci Fi movie without strong story making Skills Graphics are good Deepika has same expression from st scene to last scene in thr movie Bujji and Prabhas jokes doesnt jell so well as they expected to be linked in movie Movie length is too long more than hrs which makes audience to have good nap if show is night show I did the same so have mentioned it here I wish directors concentrate more on content not just on spending more money on movies,positive
113,Majestic at scale grandeur in VFX and great blend of scifi mythology taken at an eye popping level Proud moment indeed for Indian cinema that stands tall as a mega mountainDirector Nag Aswin takes us through three different never seen worlds First half is a bit drag with comedy elements and build up Editing could have been betterSecond half elevates to PEAKS with spectacular action sequences strong story and crisp screenplay Preinterval and climax is a hair riser and giving audience plenty of goosebumpsPrabhas is at his usual coolness and delivers Deepika Padukone emotes well and binds to her character Kamals getup and dialogue delivery will stun you There are plenty of surprises in terms of star castSir Amitabh Bachchan outweighs every other character and is the heart of the whole movie His stature voice caring attitude protective nature and breathtaking action scenes will be remembered by all agesTerrific BGM technical aspects and deeper mythological connection with a strong plot in second half will make audience go gagaTrue cinematic triumph and there will be a giant sea swell in the box office,positive
114,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
115,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
116,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive

126,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
127,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive

133,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
134,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
135,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
136,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive
137,Jack of all and master of none Have used so many heros and directors for characters in movie its more of a spoof movie kind than serious movie Making is good but not the real story that is required Sci Fi movie without strong story making Skills Graphics are good Deepika has same expression from st scene to last scene in thr movie Bujji and Prabhas jokes doesnt jell so well as they expected to be linked in movie Movie length is too long more than hrs which makes audience to have good nap if show is night show I did the same so have mentioned it here I wish directors concentrate more on content not just on spending more money on movies,positive
138,Majestic at scale grandeur in VFX and great blend of scifi mythology taken at an eye popping level Proud moment indeed for Indian cinema that stands tall as a mega mountainDirector Nag Aswin takes us through three different never seen worlds First half is a bit drag with comedy elements and build up Editing could have been betterSecond half elevates to PEAKS with spectacular action sequences strong story and crisp screenplay Preinterval and climax is a hair riser and giving audience plenty of goosebumpsPrabhas is at his usual coolness and delivers Deepika Padukone emotes well and binds to her character Kamals getup and dialogue delivery will stun you There are plenty of surprises in terms of star castSir Amitabh Bachchan outweighs every other character and is the heart of the whole movie His stature voice caring attitude protective nature and breathtaking action scenes will be remembered by all agesTerrific BGM technical aspects and deeper mythological connection with a strong plot in second half will make audience go gagaTrue cinematic triumph and there will be a giant sea swell in the box office,positive
139,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
140,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
141,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive
142,Let me share a review of the movie Kalki AD Directed by Nag Ashwin and starring Prabhas Amitabh Bachchan Kamal Haasan and Deepika Padukone this film has garnered significant attention since its first teaser release Heres what you need to knowStory Overview The film begins during the Kurukshetra war in the era of the Mahabharata Ashwatthama played by Amitabh Bachchan is cursed with immortality by Lord Krishna His penance involves safeguarding the infant when God reincarnates as Kalki predicted to happen years in the future Fast forward to that time in Kaasi people endure suffering and aspire to relocate to Complex a place resembling heaven governed by Yaskin played by Kamal Haasan The story unfolds as pregnant women including Sumati Deepika Padukone become part of Project K which extracts serum from them Bounty hunter Bhairava Prabhas is tasked with retrieving Sumati and returning her to Complex The plot weaves together these characters and three distinct worlds including ShambalaPerformances Prabhas shines as Bhairava combining superhero traits with a fun personality Amitabh Bachchans fulllength role is on par with the lead hero The film revolves primarily around these two charactersVisual Brilliance Kalki AD boasts stunning visuals making it a visual treat for audiencesWhile the film has its flaws its a gripping thriller that blends ancient Indian mythology with futuristic dystopia Whether it will break box office records remains to be seen but its definitely a noteworthy addition to Telugu cinemaRemember opinions may vary but Kalki AD is certainly an ambitious venture that combines grandeur mythology and science fiction in a unique way,neutral
143,The actual story starts years after the Mahabharat war and it is an post apocalyptic world where there is no place for Gods The world is now ruled by the Supreme leader Yaskin who is looking for a crucial serum for which he has many pregnant women held in the lab Sum aka Sumathi is one such lab rat This world still has rebels and they come from Shambhala They are awaiting the arrival of the mother carrying the prophecy Bhairava is a bounty hunter dreaming to get a place at the complex and is short of the units required As Sumathi escapes from the lab she has a savior in the form of Ashwatthama whose sole purpose is to protect her and Bhairava becomes the hurdle in the process What is this post apocalyptic world created by Yaskin and how is this related to the era of Mahabharat the answers are there in the planned cinematic universe This film just builds up the world for itNag Ashwins vision to merge mythology with scifi is laudable and it is brave of him to stick to his vision despite how much the west has influenced the post apocalyptic world creation The dramatic moments are a mixed bag considering the gigantic canvas but the film delivers on the visual front and the last minutes With hrs runtime definitely the film feels long and in the first half the narrative feels uneven as Bhairava is all the more jovial with less screen time and the last city Kasi vs the complex narrative slightly becomes complex The entertaining moments are less in the first half but there are cameos that contribute a lot It is the preinterval bit with the introduction of Ashwatthama the film shifts gear With a strong starcast Prabhas as Bhairava getting lesser screentime is made up for and Nag Ashwin gathers enough momentum to move into the second halfPost interval the pace dips till the action begins and once that happens the film throws in back to back entertaining moments The lack of elevations does lower the impact but the last mins is what truly saves the film The elevation and the big reveal in the climax was totally worth it so was the end credits reveal setting up the story for the sequel in a terrific manner Kamal Haasan as the Supreme one owns the scenes he is in but this film belongs to Amitabh Bachchan who finally gets the right treatment Prabhass character comes through as well in the last mins and the climax reveal gives him the much needed weightage which was missing in the first half Deepika Padukone does well but at this point in her career it was odd to have her play the Damsel in distress when the likes of Disha Patani as Roxie and even Anna Ben as Kyra gets to be badasses Overall the attempt alone gets the brownie points as they succeed in creating enough interest for the sequel,negative
144,It seems like the writer cum director only able to Imagine the KALKI in A D and got exhausted and then decided to copy all the top scifi movies of Hollywood from character to world building and mix it made the khichdi with Mahabharat tadka which is the only good partCopied hollywood ideas from Star wars Black Panther Alita Battle angel Dune Blade runner Mortal Engines you can also or more if you wishEven if you convince yourself that copying ideas arent that bad unless its a ripoff unfortunately KALKI A D is a complete ripoff of those ideas and lacks essence of the storyOn the other hand the special effects are also cheap levels it feels like a movie is made on low budget with unpaid interns at work and its hard to ignoreIt also feels like characters of the movie are seemingly directionless and unaware of their environmentAlso the failed to place itself neither science fiction and nor in fantasy fiction both because its distorted logic and mythological characters involved in dystopian society which tells audience that dont think too much just believe that it happens instead of explaining thingsMore over the movie doesnt seem like its crafted with passion or love rather in a capitalist POVAfter all kudos for the experiment,positive

146,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
147,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

164,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
165,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
166,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive
167,Let me share a review of the movie Kalki AD Directed by Nag Ashwin and starring Prabhas Amitabh Bachchan Kamal Haasan and Deepika Padukone this film has garnered significant attention since its first teaser release Heres what you need to knowStory Overview The film begins during the Kurukshetra war in the era of the Mahabharata Ashwatthama played by Amitabh Bachchan is cursed with immortality by Lord Krishna His penance involves safeguarding the infant when God reincarnates as Kalki predicted to happen years in the future Fast forward to that time in Kaasi people endure suffering and aspire to relocate to Complex a place resembling heaven governed by Yaskin played by Kamal Haasan The story unfolds as pregnant women including Sumati Deepika Padukone become part of Project K which extracts serum from them Bounty hunter Bhairava Prabhas is tasked with retrieving Sumati and returning her to Complex The plot weaves together these characters and three distinct worlds including ShambalaPerformances Prabhas shines as Bhairava combining superhero traits with a fun personality Amitabh Bachchans fulllength role is on par with the lead hero The film revolves primarily around these two charactersVisual Brilliance Kalki AD boasts stunning visuals making it a visual treat for audiencesWhile the film has its flaws its a gripping thriller that blends ancient Indian mythology with futuristic dystopia Whether it will break box office records remains to be seen but its definitely a noteworthy addition to Telugu cinemaRemember opinions may vary but Kalki AD is certainly an ambitious venture that combines grandeur mythology and science fiction in a unique way,neutral
168,The actual story starts years after the Mahabharat war and it is an post apocalyptic world where there is no place for Gods The world is now ruled by the Supreme leader Yaskin who is looking for a crucial serum for which he has many pregnant women held in the lab Sum aka Sumathi is one such lab rat This world still has rebels and they come from Shambhala They are awaiting the arrival of the mother carrying the prophecy Bhairava is a bounty hunter dreaming to get a place at the complex and is short of the units required As Sumathi escapes from the lab she has a savior in the form of Ashwatthama whose sole purpose is to protect her and Bhairava becomes the hurdle in the process What is this post apocalyptic world created by Yaskin and how is this related to the era of Mahabharat the answers are there in the planned cinematic universe This film just builds up the world for itNag Ashwins vision to merge mythology with scifi is laudable and it is brave of him to stick to his vision despite how much the west has influenced the post apocalyptic world creation The dramatic moments are a mixed bag considering the gigantic canvas but the film delivers on the visual front and the last minutes With hrs runtime definitely the film feels long and in the first half the narrative feels uneven as Bhairava is all the more jovial with less screen time and the last city Kasi vs the complex narrative slightly becomes complex The entertaining moments are less in the first half but there are cameos that contribute a lot It is the preinterval bit with the introduction of Ashwatthama the film shifts gear With a strong starcast Prabhas as Bhairava getting lesser screentime is made up for and Nag Ashwin gathers enough momentum to move into the second halfPost interval the pace dips till the action begins and once that happens the film throws in back to back entertaining moments The lack of elevations does lower the impact but the last mins is what truly saves the film The elevation and the big reveal in the climax was totally worth it so was the end credits reveal setting up the story for the sequel in a terrific manner Kamal Haasan as the Supreme one owns the scenes he is in but this film belongs to Amitabh Bachchan who finally gets the right treatment Prabhass character comes through as well in the last mins and the climax reveal gives him the much needed weightage which was missing in the first half Deepika Padukone does well but at this point in her career it was odd to have her play the Damsel in distress when the likes of Disha Patani as Roxie and even Anna Ben as Kyra gets to be badasses Overall the attempt alone gets the brownie points as they succeed in creating enough interest for the sequel,negative
169,It seems like the writer cum director only able to Imagine the KALKI in A D and got exhausted and then decided to copy all the top scifi movies of Hollywood from character to world building and mix it made the khichdi with Mahabharat tadka which is the only good partCopied hollywood ideas from Star wars Black Panther Alita Battle angel Dune Blade runner Mortal Engines you can also or more if you wishEven if you convince yourself that copying ideas arent that bad unless its a ripoff unfortunately KALKI A D is a complete ripoff of those ideas and lacks essence of the storyOn the other hand the special effects are also cheap levels it feels like a movie is made on low budget with unpaid interns at work and its hard to ignoreIt also feels like characters of the movie are seemingly directionless and unaware of their environmentAlso the failed to place itself neither science fiction and nor in fantasy fiction both because its distorted logic and mythological characters involved in dystopian society which tells audience that dont think too much just believe that it happens instead of explaining thingsMore over the movie doesnt seem like its crafted with passion or love rather in a capitalist POVAfter all kudos for the experiment,positive

171,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
172,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

175,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
176,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
177,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
178,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
179,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
180,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive

196,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive

200,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
201,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
202,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
203,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
204,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
205,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive
206,A unique genre a well written story script strong characters give this movie a strong start The extravagant visuals very detailed crisp VFX gives the audience much needed thrillHowever one cannot forgo the resemblance of some VFX shots have with movies like Dune Starwars mad max black panther transformersAlthough huge kudos to the team for producing a movie which is equivalent to the scale of above mentioned moviesPros Time taken to build characters explain world Stunts crisp bright visuals Screenplay Direction Comedy Cons Music background score is unique but doesnt give the much needed grandeur to the visuals and scenes repeated use of same score abruptly high background score during stunts Editing especially first half,neutral
207,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
208,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
209,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
210,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
211,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive

225,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
226,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
227,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
228,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
229,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
230,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive
231,A unique genre a well written story script strong characters give this movie a strong start The extravagant visuals very detailed crisp VFX gives the audience much needed thrillHowever one cannot forgo the resemblance of some VFX shots have with movies like Dune Starwars mad max black panther transformersAlthough huge kudos to the team for producing a movie which is equivalent to the scale of above mentioned moviesPros Time taken to build characters explain world Stunts crisp bright visuals Screenplay Direction Comedy Cons Music background score is unique but doesnt give the much needed grandeur to the visuals and scenes repeated use of same score abruptly high background score during stunts Editing especially first half,neutral
232,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
233,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
234,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
235,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
236,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive
237,Jack of all and master of none Have used so many heros and directors for characters in movie its more of a spoof movie kind than serious movie Making is good but not the real story that is required Sci Fi movie without strong story making Skills Graphics are good Deepika has same expression from st scene to last scene in thr movie Bujji and Prabhas jokes doesnt jell so well as they expected to be linked in movie Movie length is too long more than hrs which makes audience to have good nap if show is night show I did the same so have mentioned it here I wish directors concentrate more on content not just on spending more money on movies,positive
238,Majestic at scale grandeur in VFX and great blend of scifi mythology taken at an eye popping level Proud moment indeed for Indian cinema that stands tall as a mega mountainDirector Nag Aswin takes us through three different never seen worlds First half is a bit drag with comedy elements and build up Editing could have been betterSecond half elevates to PEAKS with spectacular action sequences strong story and crisp screenplay Preinterval and climax is a hair riser and giving audience plenty of goosebumpsPrabhas is at his usual coolness and delivers Deepika Padukone emotes well and binds to her character Kamals getup and dialogue delivery will stun you There are plenty of surprises in terms of star castSir Amitabh Bachchan outweighs every other character and is the heart of the whole movie His stature voice caring attitude protective nature and breathtaking action scenes will be remembered by all agesTerrific BGM technical aspects and deeper mythological connection with a strong plot in second half will make audience go gagaTrue cinematic triumph and there will be a giant sea swell in the box office,positive
239,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
240,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
241,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive

251,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
252,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive

258,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
259,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
260,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
261,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive
262,Jack of all and master of none Have used so many heros and directors for characters in movie its more of a spoof movie kind than serious movie Making is good but not the real story that is required Sci Fi movie without strong story making Skills Graphics are good Deepika has same expression from st scene to last scene in thr movie Bujji and Prabhas jokes doesnt jell so well as they expected to be linked in movie Movie length is too long more than hrs which makes audience to have good nap if show is night show I did the same so have mentioned it here I wish directors concentrate more on content not just on spending more money on movies,positive
263,Majestic at scale grandeur in VFX and great blend of scifi mythology taken at an eye popping level Proud moment indeed for Indian cinema that stands tall as a mega mountainDirector Nag Aswin takes us through three different never seen worlds First half is a bit drag with comedy elements and build up Editing could have been betterSecond half elevates to PEAKS with spectacular action sequences strong story and crisp screenplay Preinterval and climax is a hair riser and giving audience plenty of goosebumpsPrabhas is at his usual coolness and delivers Deepika Padukone emotes well and binds to her character Kamals getup and dialogue delivery will stun you There are plenty of surprises in terms of star castSir Amitabh Bachchan outweighs every other character and is the heart of the whole movie His stature voice caring attitude protective nature and breathtaking action scenes will be remembered by all agesTerrific BGM technical aspects and deeper mythological connection with a strong plot in second half will make audience go gagaTrue cinematic triumph and there will be a giant sea swell in the box office,positive
264,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
265,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
266,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive
267,Let me share a review of the movie Kalki AD Directed by Nag Ashwin and starring Prabhas Amitabh Bachchan Kamal Haasan and Deepika Padukone this film has garnered significant attention since its first teaser release Heres what you need to knowStory Overview The film begins during the Kurukshetra war in the era of the Mahabharata Ashwatthama played by Amitabh Bachchan is cursed with immortality by Lord Krishna His penance involves safeguarding the infant when God reincarnates as Kalki predicted to happen years in the future Fast forward to that time in Kaasi people endure suffering and aspire to relocate to Complex a place resembling heaven governed by Yaskin played by Kamal Haasan The story unfolds as pregnant women including Sumati Deepika Padukone become part of Project K which extracts serum from them Bounty hunter Bhairava Prabhas is tasked with retrieving Sumati and returning her to Complex The plot weaves together these characters and three distinct worlds including ShambalaPerformances Prabhas shines as Bhairava combining superhero traits with a fun personality Amitabh Bachchans fulllength role is on par with the lead hero The film revolves primarily around these two charactersVisual Brilliance Kalki AD boasts stunning visuals making it a visual treat for audiencesWhile the film has its flaws its a gripping thriller that blends ancient Indian mythology with futuristic dystopia Whether it will break box office records remains to be seen but its definitely a noteworthy addition to Telugu cinemaRemember opinions may vary but Kalki AD is certainly an ambitious venture that combines grandeur mythology and science fiction in a unique way,neutral
268,The actual story starts years after the Mahabharat war and it is an post apocalyptic world where there is no place for Gods The world is now ruled by the Supreme leader Yaskin who is looking for a crucial serum for which he has many pregnant women held in the lab Sum aka Sumathi is one such lab rat This world still has rebels and they come from Shambhala They are awaiting the arrival of the mother carrying the prophecy Bhairava is a bounty hunter dreaming to get a place at the complex and is short of the units required As Sumathi escapes from the lab she has a savior in the form of Ashwatthama whose sole purpose is to protect her and Bhairava becomes the hurdle in the process What is this post apocalyptic world created by Yaskin and how is this related to the era of Mahabharat the answers are there in the planned cinematic universe This film just builds up the world for itNag Ashwins vision to merge mythology with scifi is laudable and it is brave of him to stick to his vision despite how much the west has influenced the post apocalyptic world creation The dramatic moments are a mixed bag considering the gigantic canvas but the film delivers on the visual front and the last minutes With hrs runtime definitely the film feels long and in the first half the narrative feels uneven as Bhairava is all the more jovial with less screen time and the last city Kasi vs the complex narrative slightly becomes complex The entertaining moments are less in the first half but there are cameos that contribute a lot It is the preinterval bit with the introduction of Ashwatthama the film shifts gear With a strong starcast Prabhas as Bhairava getting lesser screentime is made up for and Nag Ashwin gathers enough momentum to move into the second halfPost interval the pace dips till the action begins and once that happens the film throws in back to back entertaining moments The lack of elevations does lower the impact but the last mins is what truly saves the film The elevation and the big reveal in the climax was totally worth it so was the end credits reveal setting up the story for the sequel in a terrific manner Kamal Haasan as the Supreme one owns the scenes he is in but this film belongs to Amitabh Bachchan who finally gets the right treatment Prabhass character comes through as well in the last mins and the climax reveal gives him the much needed weightage which was missing in the first half Deepika Padukone does well but at this point in her career it was odd to have her play the Damsel in distress when the likes of Disha Patani as Roxie and even Anna Ben as Kyra gets to be badasses Overall the attempt alone gets the brownie points as they succeed in creating enough interest for the sequel,negative
269,It seems like the writer cum director only able to Imagine the KALKI in A D and got exhausted and then decided to copy all the top scifi movies of Hollywood from character to world building and mix it made the khichdi with Mahabharat tadka which is the only good partCopied hollywood ideas from Star wars Black Panther Alita Battle angel Dune Blade runner Mortal Engines you can also or more if you wishEven if you convince yourself that copying ideas arent that bad unless its a ripoff unfortunately KALKI A D is a complete ripoff of those ideas and lacks essence of the storyOn the other hand the special effects are also cheap levels it feels like a movie is made on low budget with unpaid interns at work and its hard to ignoreIt also feels like characters of the movie are seemingly directionless and unaware of their environmentAlso the failed to place itself neither science fiction and nor in fantasy fiction both because its distorted logic and mythological characters involved in dystopian society which tells audience that dont think too much just believe that it happens instead of explaining thingsMore over the movie doesnt seem like its crafted with passion or love rather in a capitalist POVAfter all kudos for the experiment,positive

271,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
272,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

289,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
290,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
291,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive
292,Let me share a review of the movie Kalki AD Directed by Nag Ashwin and starring Prabhas Amitabh Bachchan Kamal Haasan and Deepika Padukone this film has garnered significant attention since its first teaser release Heres what you need to knowStory Overview The film begins during the Kurukshetra war in the era of the Mahabharata Ashwatthama played by Amitabh Bachchan is cursed with immortality by Lord Krishna His penance involves safeguarding the infant when God reincarnates as Kalki predicted to happen years in the future Fast forward to that time in Kaasi people endure suffering and aspire to relocate to Complex a place resembling heaven governed by Yaskin played by Kamal Haasan The story unfolds as pregnant women including Sumati Deepika Padukone become part of Project K which extracts serum from them Bounty hunter Bhairava Prabhas is tasked with retrieving Sumati and returning her to Complex The plot weaves together these characters and three distinct worlds including ShambalaPerformances Prabhas shines as Bhairava combining superhero traits with a fun personality Amitabh Bachchans fulllength role is on par with the lead hero The film revolves primarily around these two charactersVisual Brilliance Kalki AD boasts stunning visuals making it a visual treat for audiencesWhile the film has its flaws its a gripping thriller that blends ancient Indian mythology with futuristic dystopia Whether it will break box office records remains to be seen but its definitely a noteworthy addition to Telugu cinemaRemember opinions may vary but Kalki AD is certainly an ambitious venture that combines grandeur mythology and science fiction in a unique way,neutral
293,The actual story starts years after the Mahabharat war and it is an post apocalyptic world where there is no place for Gods The world is now ruled by the Supreme leader Yaskin who is looking for a crucial serum for which he has many pregnant women held in the lab Sum aka Sumathi is one such lab rat This world still has rebels and they come from Shambhala They are awaiting the arrival of the mother carrying the prophecy Bhairava is a bounty hunter dreaming to get a place at the complex and is short of the units required As Sumathi escapes from the lab she has a savior in the form of Ashwatthama whose sole purpose is to protect her and Bhairava becomes the hurdle in the process What is this post apocalyptic world created by Yaskin and how is this related to the era of Mahabharat the answers are there in the planned cinematic universe This film just builds up the world for itNag Ashwins vision to merge mythology with scifi is laudable and it is brave of him to stick to his vision despite how much the west has influenced the post apocalyptic world creation The dramatic moments are a mixed bag considering the gigantic canvas but the film delivers on the visual front and the last minutes With hrs runtime definitely the film feels long and in the first half the narrative feels uneven as Bhairava is all the more jovial with less screen time and the last city Kasi vs the complex narrative slightly becomes complex The entertaining moments are less in the first half but there are cameos that contribute a lot It is the preinterval bit with the introduction of Ashwatthama the film shifts gear With a strong starcast Prabhas as Bhairava getting lesser screentime is made up for and Nag Ashwin gathers enough momentum to move into the second halfPost interval the pace dips till the action begins and once that happens the film throws in back to back entertaining moments The lack of elevations does lower the impact but the last mins is what truly saves the film The elevation and the big reveal in the climax was totally worth it so was the end credits reveal setting up the story for the sequel in a terrific manner Kamal Haasan as the Supreme one owns the scenes he is in but this film belongs to Amitabh Bachchan who finally gets the right treatment Prabhass character comes through as well in the last mins and the climax reveal gives him the much needed weightage which was missing in the first half Deepika Padukone does well but at this point in her career it was odd to have her play the Damsel in distress when the likes of Disha Patani as Roxie and even Anna Ben as Kyra gets to be badasses Overall the attempt alone gets the brownie points as they succeed in creating enough interest for the sequel,negative
294,It seems like the writer cum director only able to Imagine the KALKI in A D and got exhausted and then decided to copy all the top scifi movies of Hollywood from character to world building and mix it made the khichdi with Mahabharat tadka which is the only good partCopied hollywood ideas from Star wars Black Panther Alita Battle angel Dune Blade runner Mortal Engines you can also or more if you wishEven if you convince yourself that copying ideas arent that bad unless its a ripoff unfortunately KALKI A D is a complete ripoff of those ideas and lacks essence of the storyOn the other hand the special effects are also cheap levels it feels like a movie is made on low budget with unpaid interns at work and its hard to ignoreIt also feels like characters of the movie are seemingly directionless and unaware of their environmentAlso the failed to place itself neither science fiction and nor in fantasy fiction both because its distorted logic and mythological characters involved in dystopian society which tells audience that dont think too much just believe that it happens instead of explaining thingsMore over the movie doesnt seem like its crafted with passion or love rather in a capitalist POVAfter all kudos for the experiment,positive

296,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
297,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

300,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
301,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
302,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
303,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
304,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
305,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive

321,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
322,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

325,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
326,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
327,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
328,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
329,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
330,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive
331,A unique genre a well written story script strong characters give this movie a strong start The extravagant visuals very detailed crisp VFX gives the audience much needed thrillHowever one cannot forgo the resemblance of some VFX shots have with movies like Dune Starwars mad max black panther transformersAlthough huge kudos to the team for producing a movie which is equivalent to the scale of above mentioned moviesPros Time taken to build characters explain world Stunts crisp bright visuals Screenplay Direction Comedy Cons Music background score is unique but doesnt give the much needed grandeur to the visuals and scenes repeated use of same score abruptly high background score during stunts Editing especially first half,neutral
332,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
333,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
334,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
335,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
336,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive

351,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
352,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
353,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
354,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
355,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive
356,A unique genre a well written story script strong characters give this movie a strong start The extravagant visuals very detailed crisp VFX gives the audience much needed thrillHowever one cannot forgo the resemblance of some VFX shots have with movies like Dune Starwars mad max black panther transformersAlthough huge kudos to the team for producing a movie which is equivalent to the scale of above mentioned moviesPros Time taken to build characters explain world Stunts crisp bright visuals Screenplay Direction Comedy Cons Music background score is unique but doesnt give the much needed grandeur to the visuals and scenes repeated use of same score abruptly high background score during stunts Editing especially first half,neutral
357,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
358,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
359,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
360,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
361,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive
362,Jack of all and master of none Have used so many heros and directors for characters in movie its more of a spoof movie kind than serious movie Making is good but not the real story that is required Sci Fi movie without strong story making Skills Graphics are good Deepika has same expression from st scene to last scene in thr movie Bujji and Prabhas jokes doesnt jell so well as they expected to be linked in movie Movie length is too long more than hrs which makes audience to have good nap if show is night show I did the same so have mentioned it here I wish directors concentrate more on content not just on spending more money on movies,positive
363,Majestic at scale grandeur in VFX and great blend of scifi mythology taken at an eye popping level Proud moment indeed for Indian cinema that stands tall as a mega mountainDirector Nag Aswin takes us through three different never seen worlds First half is a bit drag with comedy elements and build up Editing could have been betterSecond half elevates to PEAKS with spectacular action sequences strong story and crisp screenplay Preinterval and climax is a hair riser and giving audience plenty of goosebumpsPrabhas is at his usual coolness and delivers Deepika Padukone emotes well and binds to her character Kamals getup and dialogue delivery will stun you There are plenty of surprises in terms of star castSir Amitabh Bachchan outweighs every other character and is the heart of the whole movie His stature voice caring attitude protective nature and breathtaking action scenes will be remembered by all agesTerrific BGM technical aspects and deeper mythological connection with a strong plot in second half will make audience go gagaTrue cinematic triumph and there will be a giant sea swell in the box office,positive
364,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
365,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
366,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive

383,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
384,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
385,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
386,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive
387,Jack of all and master of none Have used so many heros and directors for characters in movie its more of a spoof movie kind than serious movie Making is good but not the real story that is required Sci Fi movie without strong story making Skills Graphics are good Deepika has same expression from st scene to last scene in thr movie Bujji and Prabhas jokes doesnt jell so well as they expected to be linked in movie Movie length is too long more than hrs which makes audience to have good nap if show is night show I did the same so have mentioned it here I wish directors concentrate more on content not just on spending more money on movies,positive
388,Majestic at scale grandeur in VFX and great blend of scifi mythology taken at an eye popping level Proud moment indeed for Indian cinema that stands tall as a mega mountainDirector Nag Aswin takes us through three different never seen worlds First half is a bit drag with comedy elements and build up Editing could have been betterSecond half elevates to PEAKS with spectacular action sequences strong story and crisp screenplay Preinterval and climax is a hair riser and giving audience plenty of goosebumpsPrabhas is at his usual coolness and delivers Deepika Padukone emotes well and binds to her character Kamals getup and dialogue delivery will stun you There are plenty of surprises in terms of star castSir Amitabh Bachchan outweighs every other character and is the heart of the whole movie His stature voice caring attitude protective nature and breathtaking action scenes will be remembered by all agesTerrific BGM technical aspects and deeper mythological connection with a strong plot in second half will make audience go gagaTrue cinematic triumph and there will be a giant sea swell in the box office,positive
389,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
390,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
391,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive
392,Let me share a review of the movie Kalki AD Directed by Nag Ashwin and starring Prabhas Amitabh Bachchan Kamal Haasan and Deepika Padukone this film has garnered significant attention since its first teaser release Heres what you need to knowStory Overview The film begins during the Kurukshetra war in the era of the Mahabharata Ashwatthama played by Amitabh Bachchan is cursed with immortality by Lord Krishna His penance involves safeguarding the infant when God reincarnates as Kalki predicted to happen years in the future Fast forward to that time in Kaasi people endure suffering and aspire to relocate to Complex a place resembling heaven governed by Yaskin played by Kamal Haasan The story unfolds as pregnant women including Sumati Deepika Padukone become part of Project K which extracts serum from them Bounty hunter Bhairava Prabhas is tasked with retrieving Sumati and returning her to Complex The plot weaves together these characters and three distinct worlds including ShambalaPerformances Prabhas shines as Bhairava combining superhero traits with a fun personality Amitabh Bachchans fulllength role is on par with the lead hero The film revolves primarily around these two charactersVisual Brilliance Kalki AD boasts stunning visuals making it a visual treat for audiencesWhile the film has its flaws its a gripping thriller that blends ancient Indian mythology with futuristic dystopia Whether it will break box office records remains to be seen but its definitely a noteworthy addition to Telugu cinemaRemember opinions may vary but Kalki AD is certainly an ambitious venture that combines grandeur mythology and science fiction in a unique way,neutral
393,The actual story starts years after the Mahabharat war and it is an post apocalyptic world where there is no place for Gods The world is now ruled by the Supreme leader Yaskin who is looking for a crucial serum for which he has many pregnant women held in the lab Sum aka Sumathi is one such lab rat This world still has rebels and they come from Shambhala They are awaiting the arrival of the mother carrying the prophecy Bhairava is a bounty hunter dreaming to get a place at the complex and is short of the units required As Sumathi escapes from the lab she has a savior in the form of Ashwatthama whose sole purpose is to protect her and Bhairava becomes the hurdle in the process What is this post apocalyptic world created by Yaskin and how is this related to the era of Mahabharat the answers are there in the planned cinematic universe This film just builds up the world for itNag Ashwins vision to merge mythology with scifi is laudable and it is brave of him to stick to his vision despite how much the west has influenced the post apocalyptic world creation The dramatic moments are a mixed bag considering the gigantic canvas but the film delivers on the visual front and the last minutes With hrs runtime definitely the film feels long and in the first half the narrative feels uneven as Bhairava is all the more jovial with less screen time and the last city Kasi vs the complex narrative slightly becomes complex The entertaining moments are less in the first half but there are cameos that contribute a lot It is the preinterval bit with the introduction of Ashwatthama the film shifts gear With a strong starcast Prabhas as Bhairava getting lesser screentime is made up for and Nag Ashwin gathers enough momentum to move into the second halfPost interval the pace dips till the action begins and once that happens the film throws in back to back entertaining moments The lack of elevations does lower the impact but the last mins is what truly saves the film The elevation and the big reveal in the climax was totally worth it so was the end credits reveal setting up the story for the sequel in a terrific manner Kamal Haasan as the Supreme one owns the scenes he is in but this film belongs to Amitabh Bachchan who finally gets the right treatment Prabhass character comes through as well in the last mins and the climax reveal gives him the much needed weightage which was missing in the first half Deepika Padukone does well but at this point in her career it was odd to have her play the Damsel in distress when the likes of Disha Patani as Roxie and even Anna Ben as Kyra gets to be badasses Overall the attempt alone gets the brownie points as they succeed in creating enough interest for the sequel,negative
394,It seems like the writer cum director only able to Imagine the KALKI in A D and got exhausted and then decided to copy all the top scifi movies of Hollywood from character to world building and mix it made the khichdi with Mahabharat tadka which is the only good partCopied hollywood ideas from Star wars Black Panther Alita Battle angel Dune Blade runner Mortal Engines you can also or more if you wishEven if you convince yourself that copying ideas arent that bad unless its a ripoff unfortunately KALKI A D is a complete ripoff of those ideas and lacks essence of the storyOn the other hand the special effects are also cheap levels it feels like a movie is made on low budget with unpaid interns at work and its hard to ignoreIt also feels like characters of the movie are seemingly directionless and unaware of their environmentAlso the failed to place itself neither science fiction and nor in fantasy fiction both because its distorted logic and mythological characters involved in dystopian society which tells audience that dont think too much just believe that it happens instead of explaining thingsMore over the movie doesnt seem like its crafted with passion or love rather in a capitalist POVAfter all kudos for the experiment,positive

396,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
397,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

414,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
415,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
416,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive
417,Let me share a review of the movie Kalki AD Directed by Nag Ashwin and starring Prabhas Amitabh Bachchan Kamal Haasan and Deepika Padukone this film has garnered significant attention since its first teaser release Heres what you need to knowStory Overview The film begins during the Kurukshetra war in the era of the Mahabharata Ashwatthama played by Amitabh Bachchan is cursed with immortality by Lord Krishna His penance involves safeguarding the infant when God reincarnates as Kalki predicted to happen years in the future Fast forward to that time in Kaasi people endure suffering and aspire to relocate to Complex a place resembling heaven governed by Yaskin played by Kamal Haasan The story unfolds as pregnant women including Sumati Deepika Padukone become part of Project K which extracts serum from them Bounty hunter Bhairava Prabhas is tasked with retrieving Sumati and returning her to Complex The plot weaves together these characters and three distinct worlds including ShambalaPerformances Prabhas shines as Bhairava combining superhero traits with a fun personality Amitabh Bachchans fulllength role is on par with the lead hero The film revolves primarily around these two charactersVisual Brilliance Kalki AD boasts stunning visuals making it a visual treat for audiencesWhile the film has its flaws its a gripping thriller that blends ancient Indian mythology with futuristic dystopia Whether it will break box office records remains to be seen but its definitely a noteworthy addition to Telugu cinemaRemember opinions may vary but Kalki AD is certainly an ambitious venture that combines grandeur mythology and science fiction in a unique way,neutral
418,The actual story starts years after the Mahabharat war and it is an post apocalyptic world where there is no place for Gods The world is now ruled by the Supreme leader Yaskin who is looking for a crucial serum for which he has many pregnant women held in the lab Sum aka Sumathi is one such lab rat This world still has rebels and they come from Shambhala They are awaiting the arrival of the mother carrying the prophecy Bhairava is a bounty hunter dreaming to get a place at the complex and is short of the units required As Sumathi escapes from the lab she has a savior in the form of Ashwatthama whose sole purpose is to protect her and Bhairava becomes the hurdle in the process What is this post apocalyptic world created by Yaskin and how is this related to the era of Mahabharat the answers are there in the planned cinematic universe This film just builds up the world for itNag Ashwins vision to merge mythology with scifi is laudable and it is brave of him to stick to his vision despite how much the west has influenced the post apocalyptic world creation The dramatic moments are a mixed bag considering the gigantic canvas but the film delivers on the visual front and the last minutes With hrs runtime definitely the film feels long and in the first half the narrative feels uneven as Bhairava is all the more jovial with less screen time and the last city Kasi vs the complex narrative slightly becomes complex The entertaining moments are less in the first half but there are cameos that contribute a lot It is the preinterval bit with the introduction of Ashwatthama the film shifts gear With a strong starcast Prabhas as Bhairava getting lesser screentime is made up for and Nag Ashwin gathers enough momentum to move into the second halfPost interval the pace dips till the action begins and once that happens the film throws in back to back entertaining moments The lack of elevations does lower the impact but the last mins is what truly saves the film The elevation and the big reveal in the climax was totally worth it so was the end credits reveal setting up the story for the sequel in a terrific manner Kamal Haasan as the Supreme one owns the scenes he is in but this film belongs to Amitabh Bachchan who finally gets the right treatment Prabhass character comes through as well in the last mins and the climax reveal gives him the much needed weightage which was missing in the first half Deepika Padukone does well but at this point in her career it was odd to have her play the Damsel in distress when the likes of Disha Patani as Roxie and even Anna Ben as Kyra gets to be badasses Overall the attempt alone gets the brownie points as they succeed in creating enough interest for the sequel,negative
419,It seems like the writer cum director only able to Imagine the KALKI in A D and got exhausted and then decided to copy all the top scifi movies of Hollywood from character to world building and mix it made the khichdi with Mahabharat tadka which is the only good partCopied hollywood ideas from Star wars Black Panther Alita Battle angel Dune Blade runner Mortal Engines you can also or more if you wishEven if you convince yourself that copying ideas arent that bad unless its a ripoff unfortunately KALKI A D is a complete ripoff of those ideas and lacks essence of the storyOn the other hand the special effects are also cheap levels it feels like a movie is made on low budget with unpaid interns at work and its hard to ignoreIt also feels like characters of the movie are seemingly directionless and unaware of their environmentAlso the failed to place itself neither science fiction and nor in fantasy fiction both because its distorted logic and mythological characters involved in dystopian society which tells audience that dont think too much just believe that it happens instead of explaining thingsMore over the movie doesnt seem like its crafted with passion or love rather in a capitalist POVAfter all kudos for the experiment,positive

421,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
422,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

425,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
426,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
427,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
428,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
429,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
430,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive

446,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive

450,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
451,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
452,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
453,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
454,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
455,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive
456,A unique genre a well written story script strong characters give this movie a strong start The extravagant visuals very detailed crisp VFX gives the audience much needed thrillHowever one cannot forgo the resemblance of some VFX shots have with movies like Dune Starwars mad max black panther transformersAlthough huge kudos to the team for producing a movie which is equivalent to the scale of above mentioned moviesPros Time taken to build characters explain world Stunts crisp bright visuals Screenplay Direction Comedy Cons Music background score is unique but doesnt give the much needed grandeur to the visuals and scenes repeated use of same score abruptly high background score during stunts Editing especially first half,neutral
457,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
458,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
459,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
460,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
461,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive

476,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
477,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
478,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
479,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
480,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive
481,A unique genre a well written story script strong characters give this movie a strong start The extravagant visuals very detailed crisp VFX gives the audience much needed thrillHowever one cannot forgo the resemblance of some VFX shots have with movies like Dune Starwars mad max black panther transformersAlthough huge kudos to the team for producing a movie which is equivalent to the scale of above mentioned moviesPros Time taken to build characters explain world Stunts crisp bright visuals Screenplay Direction Comedy Cons Music background score is unique but doesnt give the much needed grandeur to the visuals and scenes repeated use of same score abruptly high background score during stunts Editing especially first half,neutral
482,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
483,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
484,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
485,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
486,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive
487,Jack of all and master of none Have used so many heros and directors for characters in movie its more of a spoof movie kind than serious movie Making is good but not the real story that is required Sci Fi movie without strong story making Skills Graphics are good Deepika has same expression from st scene to last scene in thr movie Bujji and Prabhas jokes doesnt jell so well as they expected to be linked in movie Movie length is too long more than hrs which makes audience to have good nap if show is night show I did the same so have mentioned it here I wish directors concentrate more on content not just on spending more money on movies,positive
488,Majestic at scale grandeur in VFX and great blend of scifi mythology taken at an eye popping level Proud moment indeed for Indian cinema that stands tall as a mega mountainDirector Nag Aswin takes us through three different never seen worlds First half is a bit drag with comedy elements and build up Editing could have been betterSecond half elevates to PEAKS with spectacular action sequences strong story and crisp screenplay Preinterval and climax is a hair riser and giving audience plenty of goosebumpsPrabhas is at his usual coolness and delivers Deepika Padukone emotes well and binds to her character Kamals getup and dialogue delivery will stun you There are plenty of surprises in terms of star castSir Amitabh Bachchan outweighs every other character and is the heart of the whole movie His stature voice caring attitude protective nature and breathtaking action scenes will be remembered by all agesTerrific BGM technical aspects and deeper mythological connection with a strong plot in second half will make audience go gagaTrue cinematic triumph and there will be a giant sea swell in the box office,positive
489,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
490,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
491,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive

501,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
502,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive

505,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive

507,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
508,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
509,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
510,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
511,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive
512,Jack of all and master of none Have used so many heros and directors for characters in movie its more of a spoof movie kind than serious movie Making is good but not the real story that is required Sci Fi movie without strong story making Skills Graphics are good Deepika has same expression from st scene to last scene in thr movie Bujji and Prabhas jokes doesnt jell so well as they expected to be linked in movie Movie length is too long more than hrs which makes audience to have good nap if show is night show I did the same so have mentioned it here I wish directors concentrate more on content not just on spending more money on movies,positive
513,Majestic at scale grandeur in VFX and great blend of scifi mythology taken at an eye popping level Proud moment indeed for Indian cinema that stands tall as a mega mountainDirector Nag Aswin takes us through three different never seen worlds First half is a bit drag with comedy elements and build up Editing could have been betterSecond half elevates to PEAKS with spectacular action sequences strong story and crisp screenplay Preinterval and climax is a hair riser and giving audience plenty of goosebumpsPrabhas is at his usual coolness and delivers Deepika Padukone emotes well and binds to her character Kamals getup and dialogue delivery will stun you There are plenty of surprises in terms of star castSir Amitabh Bachchan outweighs every other character and is the heart of the whole movie His stature voice caring attitude protective nature and breathtaking action scenes will be remembered by all agesTerrific BGM technical aspects and deeper mythological connection with a strong plot in second half will make audience go gagaTrue cinematic triumph and there will be a giant sea swell in the box office,positive
514,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
515,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
516,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive
517,Let me share a review of the movie Kalki AD Directed by Nag Ashwin and starring Prabhas Amitabh Bachchan Kamal Haasan and Deepika Padukone this film has garnered significant attention since its first teaser release Heres what you need to knowStory Overview The film begins during the Kurukshetra war in the era of the Mahabharata Ashwatthama played by Amitabh Bachchan is cursed with immortality by Lord Krishna His penance involves safeguarding the infant when God reincarnates as Kalki predicted to happen years in the future Fast forward to that time in Kaasi people endure suffering and aspire to relocate to Complex a place resembling heaven governed by Yaskin played by Kamal Haasan The story unfolds as pregnant women including Sumati Deepika Padukone become part of Project K which extracts serum from them Bounty hunter Bhairava Prabhas is tasked with retrieving Sumati and returning her to Complex The plot weaves together these characters and three distinct worlds including ShambalaPerformances Prabhas shines as Bhairava combining superhero traits with a fun personality Amitabh Bachchans fulllength role is on par with the lead hero The film revolves primarily around these two charactersVisual Brilliance Kalki AD boasts stunning visuals making it a visual treat for audiencesWhile the film has its flaws its a gripping thriller that blends ancient Indian mythology with futuristic dystopia Whether it will break box office records remains to be seen but its definitely a noteworthy addition to Telugu cinemaRemember opinions may vary but Kalki AD is certainly an ambitious venture that combines grandeur mythology and science fiction in a unique way,neutral
518,The actual story starts years after the Mahabharat war and it is an post apocalyptic world where there is no place for Gods The world is now ruled by the Supreme leader Yaskin who is looking for a crucial serum for which he has many pregnant women held in the lab Sum aka Sumathi is one such lab rat This world still has rebels and they come from Shambhala They are awaiting the arrival of the mother carrying the prophecy Bhairava is a bounty hunter dreaming to get a place at the complex and is short of the units required As Sumathi escapes from the lab she has a savior in the form of Ashwatthama whose sole purpose is to protect her and Bhairava becomes the hurdle in the process What is this post apocalyptic world created by Yaskin and how is this related to the era of Mahabharat the answers are there in the planned cinematic universe This film just builds up the world for itNag Ashwins vision to merge mythology with scifi is laudable and it is brave of him to stick to his vision despite how much the west has influenced the post apocalyptic world creation The dramatic moments are a mixed bag considering the gigantic canvas but the film delivers on the visual front and the last minutes With hrs runtime definitely the film feels long and in the first half the narrative feels uneven as Bhairava is all the more jovial with less screen time and the last city Kasi vs the complex narrative slightly becomes complex The entertaining moments are less in the first half but there are cameos that contribute a lot It is the preinterval bit with the introduction of Ashwatthama the film shifts gear With a strong starcast Prabhas as Bhairava getting lesser screentime is made up for and Nag Ashwin gathers enough momentum to move into the second halfPost interval the pace dips till the action begins and once that happens the film throws in back to back entertaining moments The lack of elevations does lower the impact but the last mins is what truly saves the film The elevation and the big reveal in the climax was totally worth it so was the end credits reveal setting up the story for the sequel in a terrific manner Kamal Haasan as the Supreme one owns the scenes he is in but this film belongs to Amitabh Bachchan who finally gets the right treatment Prabhass character comes through as well in the last mins and the climax reveal gives him the much needed weightage which was missing in the first half Deepika Padukone does well but at this point in her career it was odd to have her play the Damsel in distress when the likes of Disha Patani as Roxie and even Anna Ben as Kyra gets to be badasses Overall the attempt alone gets the brownie points as they succeed in creating enough interest for the sequel,negative
519,It seems like the writer cum director only able to Imagine the KALKI in A D and got exhausted and then decided to copy all the top scifi movies of Hollywood from character to world building and mix it made the khichdi with Mahabharat tadka which is the only good partCopied hollywood ideas from Star wars Black Panther Alita Battle angel Dune Blade runner Mortal Engines you can also or more if you wishEven if you convince yourself that copying ideas arent that bad unless its a ripoff unfortunately KALKI A D is a complete ripoff of those ideas and lacks essence of the storyOn the other hand the special effects are also cheap levels it feels like a movie is made on low budget with unpaid interns at work and its hard to ignoreIt also feels like characters of the movie are seemingly directionless and unaware of their environmentAlso the failed to place itself neither science fiction and nor in fantasy fiction both because its distorted logic and mythological characters involved in dystopian society which tells audience that dont think too much just believe that it happens instead of explaining thingsMore over the movie doesnt seem like its crafted with passion or love rather in a capitalist POVAfter all kudos for the experiment,positive

521,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
522,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

539,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
540,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
541,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive
542,Let me share a review of the movie Kalki AD Directed by Nag Ashwin and starring Prabhas Amitabh Bachchan Kamal Haasan and Deepika Padukone this film has garnered significant attention since its first teaser release Heres what you need to knowStory Overview The film begins during the Kurukshetra war in the era of the Mahabharata Ashwatthama played by Amitabh Bachchan is cursed with immortality by Lord Krishna His penance involves safeguarding the infant when God reincarnates as Kalki predicted to happen years in the future Fast forward to that time in Kaasi people endure suffering and aspire to relocate to Complex a place resembling heaven governed by Yaskin played by Kamal Haasan The story unfolds as pregnant women including Sumati Deepika Padukone become part of Project K which extracts serum from them Bounty hunter Bhairava Prabhas is tasked with retrieving Sumati and returning her to Complex The plot weaves together these characters and three distinct worlds including ShambalaPerformances Prabhas shines as Bhairava combining superhero traits with a fun personality Amitabh Bachchans fulllength role is on par with the lead hero The film revolves primarily around these two charactersVisual Brilliance Kalki AD boasts stunning visuals making it a visual treat for audiencesWhile the film has its flaws its a gripping thriller that blends ancient Indian mythology with futuristic dystopia Whether it will break box office records remains to be seen but its definitely a noteworthy addition to Telugu cinemaRemember opinions may vary but Kalki AD is certainly an ambitious venture that combines grandeur mythology and science fiction in a unique way,neutral
543,The actual story starts years after the Mahabharat war and it is an post apocalyptic world where there is no place for Gods The world is now ruled by the Supreme leader Yaskin who is looking for a crucial serum for which he has many pregnant women held in the lab Sum aka Sumathi is one such lab rat This world still has rebels and they come from Shambhala They are awaiting the arrival of the mother carrying the prophecy Bhairava is a bounty hunter dreaming to get a place at the complex and is short of the units required As Sumathi escapes from the lab she has a savior in the form of Ashwatthama whose sole purpose is to protect her and Bhairava becomes the hurdle in the process What is this post apocalyptic world created by Yaskin and how is this related to the era of Mahabharat the answers are there in the planned cinematic universe This film just builds up the world for itNag Ashwins vision to merge mythology with scifi is laudable and it is brave of him to stick to his vision despite how much the west has influenced the post apocalyptic world creation The dramatic moments are a mixed bag considering the gigantic canvas but the film delivers on the visual front and the last minutes With hrs runtime definitely the film feels long and in the first half the narrative feels uneven as Bhairava is all the more jovial with less screen time and the last city Kasi vs the complex narrative slightly becomes complex The entertaining moments are less in the first half but there are cameos that contribute a lot It is the preinterval bit with the introduction of Ashwatthama the film shifts gear With a strong starcast Prabhas as Bhairava getting lesser screentime is made up for and Nag Ashwin gathers enough momentum to move into the second halfPost interval the pace dips till the action begins and once that happens the film throws in back to back entertaining moments The lack of elevations does lower the impact but the last mins is what truly saves the film The elevation and the big reveal in the climax was totally worth it so was the end credits reveal setting up the story for the sequel in a terrific manner Kamal Haasan as the Supreme one owns the scenes he is in but this film belongs to Amitabh Bachchan who finally gets the right treatment Prabhass character comes through as well in the last mins and the climax reveal gives him the much needed weightage which was missing in the first half Deepika Padukone does well but at this point in her career it was odd to have her play the Damsel in distress when the likes of Disha Patani as Roxie and even Anna Ben as Kyra gets to be badasses Overall the attempt alone gets the brownie points as they succeed in creating enough interest for the sequel,negative
544,It seems like the writer cum director only able to Imagine the KALKI in A D and got exhausted and then decided to copy all the top scifi movies of Hollywood from character to world building and mix it made the khichdi with Mahabharat tadka which is the only good partCopied hollywood ideas from Star wars Black Panther Alita Battle angel Dune Blade runner Mortal Engines you can also or more if you wishEven if you convince yourself that copying ideas arent that bad unless its a ripoff unfortunately KALKI A D is a complete ripoff of those ideas and lacks essence of the storyOn the other hand the special effects are also cheap levels it feels like a movie is made on low budget with unpaid interns at work and its hard to ignoreIt also feels like characters of the movie are seemingly directionless and unaware of their environmentAlso the failed to place itself neither science fiction and nor in fantasy fiction both because its distorted logic and mythological characters involved in dystopian society which tells audience that dont think too much just believe that it happens instead of explaining thingsMore over the movie doesnt seem like its crafted with passion or love rather in a capitalist POVAfter all kudos for the experiment,positive

546,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
547,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

550,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
551,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
552,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
553,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
554,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
555,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive

571,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
572,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

575,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
576,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
577,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
578,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
579,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
580,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive
581,A unique genre a well written story script strong characters give this movie a strong start The extravagant visuals very detailed crisp VFX gives the audience much needed thrillHowever one cannot forgo the resemblance of some VFX shots have with movies like Dune Starwars mad max black panther transformersAlthough huge kudos to the team for producing a movie which is equivalent to the scale of above mentioned moviesPros Time taken to build characters explain world Stunts crisp bright visuals Screenplay Direction Comedy Cons Music background score is unique but doesnt give the much needed grandeur to the visuals and scenes repeated use of same score abruptly high background score during stunts Editing especially first half,neutral
582,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
583,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
584,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
585,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
586,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive

600,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
601,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
602,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
603,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
604,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
605,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive
606,A unique genre a well written story script strong characters give this movie a strong start The extravagant visuals very detailed crisp VFX gives the audience much needed thrillHowever one cannot forgo the resemblance of some VFX shots have with movies like Dune Starwars mad max black panther transformersAlthough huge kudos to the team for producing a movie which is equivalent to the scale of above mentioned moviesPros Time taken to build characters explain world Stunts crisp bright visuals Screenplay Direction Comedy Cons Music background score is unique but doesnt give the much needed grandeur to the visuals and scenes repeated use of same score abruptly high background score during stunts Editing especially first half,neutral
607,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
608,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
609,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
610,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
611,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive
612,Jack of all and master of none Have used so many heros and directors for characters in movie its more of a spoof movie kind than serious movie Making is good but not the real story that is required Sci Fi movie without strong story making Skills Graphics are good Deepika has same expression from st scene to last scene in thr movie Bujji and Prabhas jokes doesnt jell so well as they expected to be linked in movie Movie length is too long more than hrs which makes audience to have good nap if show is night show I did the same so have mentioned it here I wish directors concentrate more on content not just on spending more money on movies,positive
613,Majestic at scale grandeur in VFX and great blend of scifi mythology taken at an eye popping level Proud moment indeed for Indian cinema that stands tall as a mega mountainDirector Nag Aswin takes us through three different never seen worlds First half is a bit drag with comedy elements and build up Editing could have been betterSecond half elevates to PEAKS with spectacular action sequences strong story and crisp screenplay Preinterval and climax is a hair riser and giving audience plenty of goosebumpsPrabhas is at his usual coolness and delivers Deepika Padukone emotes well and binds to her character Kamals getup and dialogue delivery will stun you There are plenty of surprises in terms of star castSir Amitabh Bachchan outweighs every other character and is the heart of the whole movie His stature voice caring attitude protective nature and breathtaking action scenes will be remembered by all agesTerrific BGM technical aspects and deeper mythological connection with a strong plot in second half will make audience go gagaTrue cinematic triumph and there will be a giant sea swell in the box office,positive
614,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
615,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
616,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive

633,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
634,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
635,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
636,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive
637,Jack of all and master of none Have used so many heros and directors for characters in movie its more of a spoof movie kind than serious movie Making is good but not the real story that is required Sci Fi movie without strong story making Skills Graphics are good Deepika has same expression from st scene to last scene in thr movie Bujji and Prabhas jokes doesnt jell so well as they expected to be linked in movie Movie length is too long more than hrs which makes audience to have good nap if show is night show I did the same so have mentioned it here I wish directors concentrate more on content not just on spending more money on movies,positive
638,Majestic at scale grandeur in VFX and great blend of scifi mythology taken at an eye popping level Proud moment indeed for Indian cinema that stands tall as a mega mountainDirector Nag Aswin takes us through three different never seen worlds First half is a bit drag with comedy elements and build up Editing could have been betterSecond half elevates to PEAKS with spectacular action sequences strong story and crisp screenplay Preinterval and climax is a hair riser and giving audience plenty of goosebumpsPrabhas is at his usual coolness and delivers Deepika Padukone emotes well and binds to her character Kamals getup and dialogue delivery will stun you There are plenty of surprises in terms of star castSir Amitabh Bachchan outweighs every other character and is the heart of the whole movie His stature voice caring attitude protective nature and breathtaking action scenes will be remembered by all agesTerrific BGM technical aspects and deeper mythological connection with a strong plot in second half will make audience go gagaTrue cinematic triumph and there will be a giant sea swell in the box office,positive
639,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
640,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
641,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive
642,Let me share a review of the movie Kalki AD Directed by Nag Ashwin and starring Prabhas Amitabh Bachchan Kamal Haasan and Deepika Padukone this film has garnered significant attention since its first teaser release Heres what you need to knowStory Overview The film begins during the Kurukshetra war in the era of the Mahabharata Ashwatthama played by Amitabh Bachchan is cursed with immortality by Lord Krishna His penance involves safeguarding the infant when God reincarnates as Kalki predicted to happen years in the future Fast forward to that time in Kaasi people endure suffering and aspire to relocate to Complex a place resembling heaven governed by Yaskin played by Kamal Haasan The story unfolds as pregnant women including Sumati Deepika Padukone become part of Project K which extracts serum from them Bounty hunter Bhairava Prabhas is tasked with retrieving Sumati and returning her to Complex The plot weaves together these characters and three distinct worlds including ShambalaPerformances Prabhas shines as Bhairava combining superhero traits with a fun personality Amitabh Bachchans fulllength role is on par with the lead hero The film revolves primarily around these two charactersVisual Brilliance Kalki AD boasts stunning visuals making it a visual treat for audiencesWhile the film has its flaws its a gripping thriller that blends ancient Indian mythology with futuristic dystopia Whether it will break box office records remains to be seen but its definitely a noteworthy addition to Telugu cinemaRemember opinions may vary but Kalki AD is certainly an ambitious venture that combines grandeur mythology and science fiction in a unique way,neutral
643,The actual story starts years after the Mahabharat war and it is an post apocalyptic world where there is no place for Gods The world is now ruled by the Supreme leader Yaskin who is looking for a crucial serum for which he has many pregnant women held in the lab Sum aka Sumathi is one such lab rat This world still has rebels and they come from Shambhala They are awaiting the arrival of the mother carrying the prophecy Bhairava is a bounty hunter dreaming to get a place at the complex and is short of the units required As Sumathi escapes from the lab she has a savior in the form of Ashwatthama whose sole purpose is to protect her and Bhairava becomes the hurdle in the process What is this post apocalyptic world created by Yaskin and how is this related to the era of Mahabharat the answers are there in the planned cinematic universe This film just builds up the world for itNag Ashwins vision to merge mythology with scifi is laudable and it is brave of him to stick to his vision despite how much the west has influenced the post apocalyptic world creation The dramatic moments are a mixed bag considering the gigantic canvas but the film delivers on the visual front and the last minutes With hrs runtime definitely the film feels long and in the first half the narrative feels uneven as Bhairava is all the more jovial with less screen time and the last city Kasi vs the complex narrative slightly becomes complex The entertaining moments are less in the first half but there are cameos that contribute a lot It is the preinterval bit with the introduction of Ashwatthama the film shifts gear With a strong starcast Prabhas as Bhairava getting lesser screentime is made up for and Nag Ashwin gathers enough momentum to move into the second halfPost interval the pace dips till the action begins and once that happens the film throws in back to back entertaining moments The lack of elevations does lower the impact but the last mins is what truly saves the film The elevation and the big reveal in the climax was totally worth it so was the end credits reveal setting up the story for the sequel in a terrific manner Kamal Haasan as the Supreme one owns the scenes he is in but this film belongs to Amitabh Bachchan who finally gets the right treatment Prabhass character comes through as well in the last mins and the climax reveal gives him the much needed weightage which was missing in the first half Deepika Padukone does well but at this point in her career it was odd to have her play the Damsel in distress when the likes of Disha Patani as Roxie and even Anna Ben as Kyra gets to be badasses Overall the attempt alone gets the brownie points as they succeed in creating enough interest for the sequel,negative
644,It seems like the writer cum director only able to Imagine the KALKI in A D and got exhausted and then decided to copy all the top scifi movies of Hollywood from character to world building and mix it made the khichdi with Mahabharat tadka which is the only good partCopied hollywood ideas from Star wars Black Panther Alita Battle angel Dune Blade runner Mortal Engines you can also or more if you wishEven if you convince yourself that copying ideas arent that bad unless its a ripoff unfortunately KALKI A D is a complete ripoff of those ideas and lacks essence of the storyOn the other hand the special effects are also cheap levels it feels like a movie is made on low budget with unpaid interns at work and its hard to ignoreIt also feels like characters of the movie are seemingly directionless and unaware of their environmentAlso the failed to place itself neither science fiction and nor in fantasy fiction both because its distorted logic and mythological characters involved in dystopian society which tells audience that dont think too much just believe that it happens instead of explaining thingsMore over the movie doesnt seem like its crafted with passion or love rather in a capitalist POVAfter all kudos for the experiment,positive

646,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
647,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

664,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
665,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
666,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive
667,Let me share a review of the movie Kalki AD Directed by Nag Ashwin and starring Prabhas Amitabh Bachchan Kamal Haasan and Deepika Padukone this film has garnered significant attention since its first teaser release Heres what you need to knowStory Overview The film begins during the Kurukshetra war in the era of the Mahabharata Ashwatthama played by Amitabh Bachchan is cursed with immortality by Lord Krishna His penance involves safeguarding the infant when God reincarnates as Kalki predicted to happen years in the future Fast forward to that time in Kaasi people endure suffering and aspire to relocate to Complex a place resembling heaven governed by Yaskin played by Kamal Haasan The story unfolds as pregnant women including Sumati Deepika Padukone become part of Project K which extracts serum from them Bounty hunter Bhairava Prabhas is tasked with retrieving Sumati and returning her to Complex The plot weaves together these characters and three distinct worlds including ShambalaPerformances Prabhas shines as Bhairava combining superhero traits with a fun personality Amitabh Bachchans fulllength role is on par with the lead hero The film revolves primarily around these two charactersVisual Brilliance Kalki AD boasts stunning visuals making it a visual treat for audiencesWhile the film has its flaws its a gripping thriller that blends ancient Indian mythology with futuristic dystopia Whether it will break box office records remains to be seen but its definitely a noteworthy addition to Telugu cinemaRemember opinions may vary but Kalki AD is certainly an ambitious venture that combines grandeur mythology and science fiction in a unique way,neutral
668,The actual story starts years after the Mahabharat war and it is an post apocalyptic world where there is no place for Gods The world is now ruled by the Supreme leader Yaskin who is looking for a crucial serum for which he has many pregnant women held in the lab Sum aka Sumathi is one such lab rat This world still has rebels and they come from Shambhala They are awaiting the arrival of the mother carrying the prophecy Bhairava is a bounty hunter dreaming to get a place at the complex and is short of the units required As Sumathi escapes from the lab she has a savior in the form of Ashwatthama whose sole purpose is to protect her and Bhairava becomes the hurdle in the process What is this post apocalyptic world created by Yaskin and how is this related to the era of Mahabharat the answers are there in the planned cinematic universe This film just builds up the world for itNag Ashwins vision to merge mythology with scifi is laudable and it is brave of him to stick to his vision despite how much the west has influenced the post apocalyptic world creation The dramatic moments are a mixed bag considering the gigantic canvas but the film delivers on the visual front and the last minutes With hrs runtime definitely the film feels long and in the first half the narrative feels uneven as Bhairava is all the more jovial with less screen time and the last city Kasi vs the complex narrative slightly becomes complex The entertaining moments are less in the first half but there are cameos that contribute a lot It is the preinterval bit with the introduction of Ashwatthama the film shifts gear With a strong starcast Prabhas as Bhairava getting lesser screentime is made up for and Nag Ashwin gathers enough momentum to move into the second halfPost interval the pace dips till the action begins and once that happens the film throws in back to back entertaining moments The lack of elevations does lower the impact but the last mins is what truly saves the film The elevation and the big reveal in the climax was totally worth it so was the end credits reveal setting up the story for the sequel in a terrific manner Kamal Haasan as the Supreme one owns the scenes he is in but this film belongs to Amitabh Bachchan who finally gets the right treatment Prabhass character comes through as well in the last mins and the climax reveal gives him the much needed weightage which was missing in the first half Deepika Padukone does well but at this point in her career it was odd to have her play the Damsel in distress when the likes of Disha Patani as Roxie and even Anna Ben as Kyra gets to be badasses Overall the attempt alone gets the brownie points as they succeed in creating enough interest for the sequel,negative
669,It seems like the writer cum director only able to Imagine the KALKI in A D and got exhausted and then decided to copy all the top scifi movies of Hollywood from character to world building and mix it made the khichdi with Mahabharat tadka which is the only good partCopied hollywood ideas from Star wars Black Panther Alita Battle angel Dune Blade runner Mortal Engines you can also or more if you wishEven if you convince yourself that copying ideas arent that bad unless its a ripoff unfortunately KALKI A D is a complete ripoff of those ideas and lacks essence of the storyOn the other hand the special effects are also cheap levels it feels like a movie is made on low budget with unpaid interns at work and its hard to ignoreIt also feels like characters of the movie are seemingly directionless and unaware of their environmentAlso the failed to place itself neither science fiction and nor in fantasy fiction both because its distorted logic and mythological characters involved in dystopian society which tells audience that dont think too much just believe that it happens instead of explaining thingsMore over the movie doesnt seem like its crafted with passion or love rather in a capitalist POVAfter all kudos for the experiment,positive

671,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
672,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

675,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
676,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
677,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
678,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
679,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
680,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive

696,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive

700,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
701,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
702,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
703,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
704,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
705,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive
706,A unique genre a well written story script strong characters give this movie a strong start The extravagant visuals very detailed crisp VFX gives the audience much needed thrillHowever one cannot forgo the resemblance of some VFX shots have with movies like Dune Starwars mad max black panther transformersAlthough huge kudos to the team for producing a movie which is equivalent to the scale of above mentioned moviesPros Time taken to build characters explain world Stunts crisp bright visuals Screenplay Direction Comedy Cons Music background score is unique but doesnt give the much needed grandeur to the visuals and scenes repeated use of same score abruptly high background score during stunts Editing especially first half,neutral
707,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
708,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
709,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
710,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
711,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive

726,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
727,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
728,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
729,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
730,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive
731,A unique genre a well written story script strong characters give this movie a strong start The extravagant visuals very detailed crisp VFX gives the audience much needed thrillHowever one cannot forgo the resemblance of some VFX shots have with movies like Dune Starwars mad max black panther transformersAlthough huge kudos to the team for producing a movie which is equivalent to the scale of above mentioned moviesPros Time taken to build characters explain world Stunts crisp bright visuals Screenplay Direction Comedy Cons Music background score is unique but doesnt give the much needed grandeur to the visuals and scenes repeated use of same score abruptly high background score during stunts Editing especially first half,neutral
732,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
733,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
734,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
735,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
736,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive
737,Jack of all and master of none Have used so many heros and directors for characters in movie its more of a spoof movie kind than serious movie Making is good but not the real story that is required Sci Fi movie without strong story making Skills Graphics are good Deepika has same expression from st scene to last scene in thr movie Bujji and Prabhas jokes doesnt jell so well as they expected to be linked in movie Movie length is too long more than hrs which makes audience to have good nap if show is night show I did the same so have mentioned it here I wish directors concentrate more on content not just on spending more money on movies,positive
738,Majestic at scale grandeur in VFX and great blend of scifi mythology taken at an eye popping level Proud moment indeed for Indian cinema that stands tall as a mega mountainDirector Nag Aswin takes us through three different never seen worlds First half is a bit drag with comedy elements and build up Editing could have been betterSecond half elevates to PEAKS with spectacular action sequences strong story and crisp screenplay Preinterval and climax is a hair riser and giving audience plenty of goosebumpsPrabhas is at his usual coolness and delivers Deepika Padukone emotes well and binds to her character Kamals getup and dialogue delivery will stun you There are plenty of surprises in terms of star castSir Amitabh Bachchan outweighs every other character and is the heart of the whole movie His stature voice caring attitude protective nature and breathtaking action scenes will be remembered by all agesTerrific BGM technical aspects and deeper mythological connection with a strong plot in second half will make audience go gagaTrue cinematic triumph and there will be a giant sea swell in the box office,positive
739,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
740,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
741,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive

758,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
759,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
760,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
761,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive
762,Jack of all and master of none Have used so many heros and directors for characters in movie its more of a spoof movie kind than serious movie Making is good but not the real story that is required Sci Fi movie without strong story making Skills Graphics are good Deepika has same expression from st scene to last scene in thr movie Bujji and Prabhas jokes doesnt jell so well as they expected to be linked in movie Movie length is too long more than hrs which makes audience to have good nap if show is night show I did the same so have mentioned it here I wish directors concentrate more on content not just on spending more money on movies,positive
763,Majestic at scale grandeur in VFX and great blend of scifi mythology taken at an eye popping level Proud moment indeed for Indian cinema that stands tall as a mega mountainDirector Nag Aswin takes us through three different never seen worlds First half is a bit drag with comedy elements and build up Editing could have been betterSecond half elevates to PEAKS with spectacular action sequences strong story and crisp screenplay Preinterval and climax is a hair riser and giving audience plenty of goosebumpsPrabhas is at his usual coolness and delivers Deepika Padukone emotes well and binds to her character Kamals getup and dialogue delivery will stun you There are plenty of surprises in terms of star castSir Amitabh Bachchan outweighs every other character and is the heart of the whole movie His stature voice caring attitude protective nature and breathtaking action scenes will be remembered by all agesTerrific BGM technical aspects and deeper mythological connection with a strong plot in second half will make audience go gagaTrue cinematic triumph and there will be a giant sea swell in the box office,positive
764,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
765,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
766,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive
767,Let me share a review of the movie Kalki AD Directed by Nag Ashwin and starring Prabhas Amitabh Bachchan Kamal Haasan and Deepika Padukone this film has garnered significant attention since its first teaser release Heres what you need to knowStory Overview The film begins during the Kurukshetra war in the era of the Mahabharata Ashwatthama played by Amitabh Bachchan is cursed with immortality by Lord Krishna His penance involves safeguarding the infant when God reincarnates as Kalki predicted to happen years in the future Fast forward to that time in Kaasi people endure suffering and aspire to relocate to Complex a place resembling heaven governed by Yaskin played by Kamal Haasan The story unfolds as pregnant women including Sumati Deepika Padukone become part of Project K which extracts serum from them Bounty hunter Bhairava Prabhas is tasked with retrieving Sumati and returning her to Complex The plot weaves together these characters and three distinct worlds including ShambalaPerformances Prabhas shines as Bhairava combining superhero traits with a fun personality Amitabh Bachchans fulllength role is on par with the lead hero The film revolves primarily around these two charactersVisual Brilliance Kalki AD boasts stunning visuals making it a visual treat for audiencesWhile the film has its flaws its a gripping thriller that blends ancient Indian mythology with futuristic dystopia Whether it will break box office records remains to be seen but its definitely a noteworthy addition to Telugu cinemaRemember opinions may vary but Kalki AD is certainly an ambitious venture that combines grandeur mythology and science fiction in a unique way,neutral
768,The actual story starts years after the Mahabharat war and it is an post apocalyptic world where there is no place for Gods The world is now ruled by the Supreme leader Yaskin who is looking for a crucial serum for which he has many pregnant women held in the lab Sum aka Sumathi is one such lab rat This world still has rebels and they come from Shambhala They are awaiting the arrival of the mother carrying the prophecy Bhairava is a bounty hunter dreaming to get a place at the complex and is short of the units required As Sumathi escapes from the lab she has a savior in the form of Ashwatthama whose sole purpose is to protect her and Bhairava becomes the hurdle in the process What is this post apocalyptic world created by Yaskin and how is this related to the era of Mahabharat the answers are there in the planned cinematic universe This film just builds up the world for itNag Ashwins vision to merge mythology with scifi is laudable and it is brave of him to stick to his vision despite how much the west has influenced the post apocalyptic world creation The dramatic moments are a mixed bag considering the gigantic canvas but the film delivers on the visual front and the last minutes With hrs runtime definitely the film feels long and in the first half the narrative feels uneven as Bhairava is all the more jovial with less screen time and the last city Kasi vs the complex narrative slightly becomes complex The entertaining moments are less in the first half but there are cameos that contribute a lot It is the preinterval bit with the introduction of Ashwatthama the film shifts gear With a strong starcast Prabhas as Bhairava getting lesser screentime is made up for and Nag Ashwin gathers enough momentum to move into the second halfPost interval the pace dips till the action begins and once that happens the film throws in back to back entertaining moments The lack of elevations does lower the impact but the last mins is what truly saves the film The elevation and the big reveal in the climax was totally worth it so was the end credits reveal setting up the story for the sequel in a terrific manner Kamal Haasan as the Supreme one owns the scenes he is in but this film belongs to Amitabh Bachchan who finally gets the right treatment Prabhass character comes through as well in the last mins and the climax reveal gives him the much needed weightage which was missing in the first half Deepika Padukone does well but at this point in her career it was odd to have her play the Damsel in distress when the likes of Disha Patani as Roxie and even Anna Ben as Kyra gets to be badasses Overall the attempt alone gets the brownie points as they succeed in creating enough interest for the sequel,negative
769,It seems like the writer cum director only able to Imagine the KALKI in A D and got exhausted and then decided to copy all the top scifi movies of Hollywood from character to world building and mix it made the khichdi with Mahabharat tadka which is the only good partCopied hollywood ideas from Star wars Black Panther Alita Battle angel Dune Blade runner Mortal Engines you can also or more if you wishEven if you convince yourself that copying ideas arent that bad unless its a ripoff unfortunately KALKI A D is a complete ripoff of those ideas and lacks essence of the storyOn the other hand the special effects are also cheap levels it feels like a movie is made on low budget with unpaid interns at work and its hard to ignoreIt also feels like characters of the movie are seemingly directionless and unaware of their environmentAlso the failed to place itself neither science fiction and nor in fantasy fiction both because its distorted logic and mythological characters involved in dystopian society which tells audience that dont think too much just believe that it happens instead of explaining thingsMore over the movie doesnt seem like its crafted with passion or love rather in a capitalist POVAfter all kudos for the experiment,positive

771,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
772,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

789,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
790,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
791,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive
792,Let me share a review of the movie Kalki AD Directed by Nag Ashwin and starring Prabhas Amitabh Bachchan Kamal Haasan and Deepika Padukone this film has garnered significant attention since its first teaser release Heres what you need to knowStory Overview The film begins during the Kurukshetra war in the era of the Mahabharata Ashwatthama played by Amitabh Bachchan is cursed with immortality by Lord Krishna His penance involves safeguarding the infant when God reincarnates as Kalki predicted to happen years in the future Fast forward to that time in Kaasi people endure suffering and aspire to relocate to Complex a place resembling heaven governed by Yaskin played by Kamal Haasan The story unfolds as pregnant women including Sumati Deepika Padukone become part of Project K which extracts serum from them Bounty hunter Bhairava Prabhas is tasked with retrieving Sumati and returning her to Complex The plot weaves together these characters and three distinct worlds including ShambalaPerformances Prabhas shines as Bhairava combining superhero traits with a fun personality Amitabh Bachchans fulllength role is on par with the lead hero The film revolves primarily around these two charactersVisual Brilliance Kalki AD boasts stunning visuals making it a visual treat for audiencesWhile the film has its flaws its a gripping thriller that blends ancient Indian mythology with futuristic dystopia Whether it will break box office records remains to be seen but its definitely a noteworthy addition to Telugu cinemaRemember opinions may vary but Kalki AD is certainly an ambitious venture that combines grandeur mythology and science fiction in a unique way,neutral
793,The actual story starts years after the Mahabharat war and it is an post apocalyptic world where there is no place for Gods The world is now ruled by the Supreme leader Yaskin who is looking for a crucial serum for which he has many pregnant women held in the lab Sum aka Sumathi is one such lab rat This world still has rebels and they come from Shambhala They are awaiting the arrival of the mother carrying the prophecy Bhairava is a bounty hunter dreaming to get a place at the complex and is short of the units required As Sumathi escapes from the lab she has a savior in the form of Ashwatthama whose sole purpose is to protect her and Bhairava becomes the hurdle in the process What is this post apocalyptic world created by Yaskin and how is this related to the era of Mahabharat the answers are there in the planned cinematic universe This film just builds up the world for itNag Ashwins vision to merge mythology with scifi is laudable and it is brave of him to stick to his vision despite how much the west has influenced the post apocalyptic world creation The dramatic moments are a mixed bag considering the gigantic canvas but the film delivers on the visual front and the last minutes With hrs runtime definitely the film feels long and in the first half the narrative feels uneven as Bhairava is all the more jovial with less screen time and the last city Kasi vs the complex narrative slightly becomes complex The entertaining moments are less in the first half but there are cameos that contribute a lot It is the preinterval bit with the introduction of Ashwatthama the film shifts gear With a strong starcast Prabhas as Bhairava getting lesser screentime is made up for and Nag Ashwin gathers enough momentum to move into the second halfPost interval the pace dips till the action begins and once that happens the film throws in back to back entertaining moments The lack of elevations does lower the impact but the last mins is what truly saves the film The elevation and the big reveal in the climax was totally worth it so was the end credits reveal setting up the story for the sequel in a terrific manner Kamal Haasan as the Supreme one owns the scenes he is in but this film belongs to Amitabh Bachchan who finally gets the right treatment Prabhass character comes through as well in the last mins and the climax reveal gives him the much needed weightage which was missing in the first half Deepika Padukone does well but at this point in her career it was odd to have her play the Damsel in distress when the likes of Disha Patani as Roxie and even Anna Ben as Kyra gets to be badasses Overall the attempt alone gets the brownie points as they succeed in creating enough interest for the sequel,negative
794,It seems like the writer cum director only able to Imagine the KALKI in A D and got exhausted and then decided to copy all the top scifi movies of Hollywood from character to world building and mix it made the khichdi with Mahabharat tadka which is the only good partCopied hollywood ideas from Star wars Black Panther Alita Battle angel Dune Blade runner Mortal Engines you can also or more if you wishEven if you convince yourself that copying ideas arent that bad unless its a ripoff unfortunately KALKI A D is a complete ripoff of those ideas and lacks essence of the storyOn the other hand the special effects are also cheap levels it feels like a movie is made on low budget with unpaid interns at work and its hard to ignoreIt also feels like characters of the movie are seemingly directionless and unaware of their environmentAlso the failed to place itself neither science fiction and nor in fantasy fiction both because its distorted logic and mythological characters involved in dystopian society which tells audience that dont think too much just believe that it happens instead of explaining thingsMore over the movie doesnt seem like its crafted with passion or love rather in a capitalist POVAfter all kudos for the experiment,positive

796,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
797,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

800,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
801,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
802,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
803,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
804,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
805,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive

821,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive

825,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
826,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
827,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
828,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
829,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
830,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive
831,A unique genre a well written story script strong characters give this movie a strong start The extravagant visuals very detailed crisp VFX gives the audience much needed thrillHowever one cannot forgo the resemblance of some VFX shots have with movies like Dune Starwars mad max black panther transformersAlthough huge kudos to the team for producing a movie which is equivalent to the scale of above mentioned moviesPros Time taken to build characters explain world Stunts crisp bright visuals Screenplay Direction Comedy Cons Music background score is unique but doesnt give the much needed grandeur to the visuals and scenes repeated use of same score abruptly high background score during stunts Editing especially first half,neutral
832,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
833,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
834,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
835,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
836,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive

851,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
852,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
853,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
854,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
855,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive
856,A unique genre a well written story script strong characters give this movie a strong start The extravagant visuals very detailed crisp VFX gives the audience much needed thrillHowever one cannot forgo the resemblance of some VFX shots have with movies like Dune Starwars mad max black panther transformersAlthough huge kudos to the team for producing a movie which is equivalent to the scale of above mentioned moviesPros Time taken to build characters explain world Stunts crisp bright visuals Screenplay Direction Comedy Cons Music background score is unique but doesnt give the much needed grandeur to the visuals and scenes repeated use of same score abruptly high background score during stunts Editing especially first half,neutral
857,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
858,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
859,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
860,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
861,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive
862,Jack of all and master of none Have used so many heros and directors for characters in movie its more of a spoof movie kind than serious movie Making is good but not the real story that is required Sci Fi movie without strong story making Skills Graphics are good Deepika has same expression from st scene to last scene in thr movie Bujji and Prabhas jokes doesnt jell so well as they expected to be linked in movie Movie length is too long more than hrs which makes audience to have good nap if show is night show I did the same so have mentioned it here I wish directors concentrate more on content not just on spending more money on movies,positive
863,Majestic at scale grandeur in VFX and great blend of scifi mythology taken at an eye popping level Proud moment indeed for Indian cinema that stands tall as a mega mountainDirector Nag Aswin takes us through three different never seen worlds First half is a bit drag with comedy elements and build up Editing could have been betterSecond half elevates to PEAKS with spectacular action sequences strong story and crisp screenplay Preinterval and climax is a hair riser and giving audience plenty of goosebumpsPrabhas is at his usual coolness and delivers Deepika Padukone emotes well and binds to her character Kamals getup and dialogue delivery will stun you There are plenty of surprises in terms of star castSir Amitabh Bachchan outweighs every other character and is the heart of the whole movie His stature voice caring attitude protective nature and breathtaking action scenes will be remembered by all agesTerrific BGM technical aspects and deeper mythological connection with a strong plot in second half will make audience go gagaTrue cinematic triumph and there will be a giant sea swell in the box office,positive
864,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
865,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
866,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive

883,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
884,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
885,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
886,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive
887,Jack of all and master of none Have used so many heros and directors for characters in movie its more of a spoof movie kind than serious movie Making is good but not the real story that is required Sci Fi movie without strong story making Skills Graphics are good Deepika has same expression from st scene to last scene in thr movie Bujji and Prabhas jokes doesnt jell so well as they expected to be linked in movie Movie length is too long more than hrs which makes audience to have good nap if show is night show I did the same so have mentioned it here I wish directors concentrate more on content not just on spending more money on movies,positive
888,Majestic at scale grandeur in VFX and great blend of scifi mythology taken at an eye popping level Proud moment indeed for Indian cinema that stands tall as a mega mountainDirector Nag Aswin takes us through three different never seen worlds First half is a bit drag with comedy elements and build up Editing could have been betterSecond half elevates to PEAKS with spectacular action sequences strong story and crisp screenplay Preinterval and climax is a hair riser and giving audience plenty of goosebumpsPrabhas is at his usual coolness and delivers Deepika Padukone emotes well and binds to her character Kamals getup and dialogue delivery will stun you There are plenty of surprises in terms of star castSir Amitabh Bachchan outweighs every other character and is the heart of the whole movie His stature voice caring attitude protective nature and breathtaking action scenes will be remembered by all agesTerrific BGM technical aspects and deeper mythological connection with a strong plot in second half will make audience go gagaTrue cinematic triumph and there will be a giant sea swell in the box office,positive
889,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
890,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
891,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive
892,Let me share a review of the movie Kalki AD Directed by Nag Ashwin and starring Prabhas Amitabh Bachchan Kamal Haasan and Deepika Padukone this film has garnered significant attention since its first teaser release Heres what you need to knowStory Overview The film begins during the Kurukshetra war in the era of the Mahabharata Ashwatthama played by Amitabh Bachchan is cursed with immortality by Lord Krishna His penance involves safeguarding the infant when God reincarnates as Kalki predicted to happen years in the future Fast forward to that time in Kaasi people endure suffering and aspire to relocate to Complex a place resembling heaven governed by Yaskin played by Kamal Haasan The story unfolds as pregnant women including Sumati Deepika Padukone become part of Project K which extracts serum from them Bounty hunter Bhairava Prabhas is tasked with retrieving Sumati and returning her to Complex The plot weaves together these characters and three distinct worlds including ShambalaPerformances Prabhas shines as Bhairava combining superhero traits with a fun personality Amitabh Bachchans fulllength role is on par with the lead hero The film revolves primarily around these two charactersVisual Brilliance Kalki AD boasts stunning visuals making it a visual treat for audiencesWhile the film has its flaws its a gripping thriller that blends ancient Indian mythology with futuristic dystopia Whether it will break box office records remains to be seen but its definitely a noteworthy addition to Telugu cinemaRemember opinions may vary but Kalki AD is certainly an ambitious venture that combines grandeur mythology and science fiction in a unique way,neutral
893,The actual story starts years after the Mahabharat war and it is an post apocalyptic world where there is no place for Gods The world is now ruled by the Supreme leader Yaskin who is looking for a crucial serum for which he has many pregnant women held in the lab Sum aka Sumathi is one such lab rat This world still has rebels and they come from Shambhala They are awaiting the arrival of the mother carrying the prophecy Bhairava is a bounty hunter dreaming to get a place at the complex and is short of the units required As Sumathi escapes from the lab she has a savior in the form of Ashwatthama whose sole purpose is to protect her and Bhairava becomes the hurdle in the process What is this post apocalyptic world created by Yaskin and how is this related to the era of Mahabharat the answers are there in the planned cinematic universe This film just builds up the world for itNag Ashwins vision to merge mythology with scifi is laudable and it is brave of him to stick to his vision despite how much the west has influenced the post apocalyptic world creation The dramatic moments are a mixed bag considering the gigantic canvas but the film delivers on the visual front and the last minutes With hrs runtime definitely the film feels long and in the first half the narrative feels uneven as Bhairava is all the more jovial with less screen time and the last city Kasi vs the complex narrative slightly becomes complex The entertaining moments are less in the first half but there are cameos that contribute a lot It is the preinterval bit with the introduction of Ashwatthama the film shifts gear With a strong starcast Prabhas as Bhairava getting lesser screentime is made up for and Nag Ashwin gathers enough momentum to move into the second halfPost interval the pace dips till the action begins and once that happens the film throws in back to back entertaining moments The lack of elevations does lower the impact but the last mins is what truly saves the film The elevation and the big reveal in the climax was totally worth it so was the end credits reveal setting up the story for the sequel in a terrific manner Kamal Haasan as the Supreme one owns the scenes he is in but this film belongs to Amitabh Bachchan who finally gets the right treatment Prabhass character comes through as well in the last mins and the climax reveal gives him the much needed weightage which was missing in the first half Deepika Padukone does well but at this point in her career it was odd to have her play the Damsel in distress when the likes of Disha Patani as Roxie and even Anna Ben as Kyra gets to be badasses Overall the attempt alone gets the brownie points as they succeed in creating enough interest for the sequel,negative
894,It seems like the writer cum director only able to Imagine the KALKI in A D and got exhausted and then decided to copy all the top scifi movies of Hollywood from character to world building and mix it made the khichdi with Mahabharat tadka which is the only good partCopied hollywood ideas from Star wars Black Panther Alita Battle angel Dune Blade runner Mortal Engines you can also or more if you wishEven if you convince yourself that copying ideas arent that bad unless its a ripoff unfortunately KALKI A D is a complete ripoff of those ideas and lacks essence of the storyOn the other hand the special effects are also cheap levels it feels like a movie is made on low budget with unpaid interns at work and its hard to ignoreIt also feels like characters of the movie are seemingly directionless and unaware of their environmentAlso the failed to place itself neither science fiction and nor in fantasy fiction both because its distorted logic and mythological characters involved in dystopian society which tells audience that dont think too much just believe that it happens instead of explaining thingsMore over the movie doesnt seem like its crafted with passion or love rather in a capitalist POVAfter all kudos for the experiment,positive

896,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive

914,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
915,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
916,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive
917,Let me share a review of the movie Kalki AD Directed by Nag Ashwin and starring Prabhas Amitabh Bachchan Kamal Haasan and Deepika Padukone this film has garnered significant attention since its first teaser release Heres what you need to knowStory Overview The film begins during the Kurukshetra war in the era of the Mahabharata Ashwatthama played by Amitabh Bachchan is cursed with immortality by Lord Krishna His penance involves safeguarding the infant when God reincarnates as Kalki predicted to happen years in the future Fast forward to that time in Kaasi people endure suffering and aspire to relocate to Complex a place resembling heaven governed by Yaskin played by Kamal Haasan The story unfolds as pregnant women including Sumati Deepika Padukone become part of Project K which extracts serum from them Bounty hunter Bhairava Prabhas is tasked with retrieving Sumati and returning her to Complex The plot weaves together these characters and three distinct worlds including ShambalaPerformances Prabhas shines as Bhairava combining superhero traits with a fun personality Amitabh Bachchans fulllength role is on par with the lead hero The film revolves primarily around these two charactersVisual Brilliance Kalki AD boasts stunning visuals making it a visual treat for audiencesWhile the film has its flaws its a gripping thriller that blends ancient Indian mythology with futuristic dystopia Whether it will break box office records remains to be seen but its definitely a noteworthy addition to Telugu cinemaRemember opinions may vary but Kalki AD is certainly an ambitious venture that combines grandeur mythology and science fiction in a unique way,neutral
918,The actual story starts years after the Mahabharat war and it is an post apocalyptic world where there is no place for Gods The world is now ruled by the Supreme leader Yaskin who is looking for a crucial serum for which he has many pregnant women held in the lab Sum aka Sumathi is one such lab rat This world still has rebels and they come from Shambhala They are awaiting the arrival of the mother carrying the prophecy Bhairava is a bounty hunter dreaming to get a place at the complex and is short of the units required As Sumathi escapes from the lab she has a savior in the form of Ashwatthama whose sole purpose is to protect her and Bhairava becomes the hurdle in the process What is this post apocalyptic world created by Yaskin and how is this related to the era of Mahabharat the answers are there in the planned cinematic universe This film just builds up the world for itNag Ashwins vision to merge mythology with scifi is laudable and it is brave of him to stick to his vision despite how much the west has influenced the post apocalyptic world creation The dramatic moments are a mixed bag considering the gigantic canvas but the film delivers on the visual front and the last minutes With hrs runtime definitely the film feels long and in the first half the narrative feels uneven as Bhairava is all the more jovial with less screen time and the last city Kasi vs the complex narrative slightly becomes complex The entertaining moments are less in the first half but there are cameos that contribute a lot It is the preinterval bit with the introduction of Ashwatthama the film shifts gear With a strong starcast Prabhas as Bhairava getting lesser screentime is made up for and Nag Ashwin gathers enough momentum to move into the second halfPost interval the pace dips till the action begins and once that happens the film throws in back to back entertaining moments The lack of elevations does lower the impact but the last mins is what truly saves the film The elevation and the big reveal in the climax was totally worth it so was the end credits reveal setting up the story for the sequel in a terrific manner Kamal Haasan as the Supreme one owns the scenes he is in but this film belongs to Amitabh Bachchan who finally gets the right treatment Prabhass character comes through as well in the last mins and the climax reveal gives him the much needed weightage which was missing in the first half Deepika Padukone does well but at this point in her career it was odd to have her play the Damsel in distress when the likes of Disha Patani as Roxie and even Anna Ben as Kyra gets to be badasses Overall the attempt alone gets the brownie points as they succeed in creating enough interest for the sequel,negative
919,It seems like the writer cum director only able to Imagine the KALKI in A D and got exhausted and then decided to copy all the top scifi movies of Hollywood from character to world building and mix it made the khichdi with Mahabharat tadka which is the only good partCopied hollywood ideas from Star wars Black Panther Alita Battle angel Dune Blade runner Mortal Engines you can also or more if you wishEven if you convince yourself that copying ideas arent that bad unless its a ripoff unfortunately KALKI A D is a complete ripoff of those ideas and lacks essence of the storyOn the other hand the special effects are also cheap levels it feels like a movie is made on low budget with unpaid interns at work and its hard to ignoreIt also feels like characters of the movie are seemingly directionless and unaware of their environmentAlso the failed to place itself neither science fiction and nor in fantasy fiction both because its distorted logic and mythological characters involved in dystopian society which tells audience that dont think too much just believe that it happens instead of explaining thingsMore over the movie doesnt seem like its crafted with passion or love rather in a capitalist POVAfter all kudos for the experiment,positive

921,The movie is sleepy in the initial hour literally and you will feel like damm i should nod off but then its Amitabhs acting the lifts the bar and raises excitementFor those publicising Prabhas he just a joke until the very end at which time he redeems himself Just not worth the hyper people have createdDeepika as usual is just a glam like Mother of Dragons from GOT and has next to none dialoguesDirection and VFS is a million on Some ideas copied from Mad max fury for sure but i guess that can be subsidedAll in all its a good pickup post the interval only And the ending is indeed worth part,positive
922,Indian Mad max Indian Matrix Batmans technologies etc All mixed up Lots of herogiri Totally out of original storyline we expected Mahabharata Its just Amitabh Bachchan who made sense What is Kamal Hasan doing Ive failed to understand st half ie Around hour was useless and made very little sense Why big b agreed to do these movies I got no idea However he did his best performance This wouldve been a great movie if they stick to the real post Mahabharata story hour of crazy nonsense actions and then few minutes of Aswathama and Mahabharata And where is Kamal Hasan Anyway you can spend maximum for this weekend time pass,positive

925,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
926,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
927,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
928,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
929,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
930,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive

950,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
951,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
952,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
953,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
954,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
955,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive
956,A unique genre a well written story script strong characters give this movie a strong start The extravagant visuals very detailed crisp VFX gives the audience much needed thrillHowever one cannot forgo the resemblance of some VFX shots have with movies like Dune Starwars mad max black panther transformersAlthough huge kudos to the team for producing a movie which is equivalent to the scale of above mentioned moviesPros Time taken to build characters explain world Stunts crisp bright visuals Screenplay Direction Comedy Cons Music background score is unique but doesnt give the much needed grandeur to the visuals and scenes repeated use of same score abruptly high background score during stunts Editing especially first half,neutral
957,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
958,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
959,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
960,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
961,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive

975,Best Indian movie Nagi combined Hindu mythology with future great VFX at par with Hollywood good concept in the script and Prabhas and Bachan dusted itEven there no disappointment for darling nagi smartly added some fan based elevations He also carefully narrated the story without getting boredThe touch of Rajamouli RGV Dulquer and Vijay Devarakonda is superb which boosted scenes in betweeenFinally this movie deserves out due to Nagi daring attempt to imagine such kind of a big movie perfect story and extraordinary screenplayEveryone can watch this movie no obscene words or scenes,positive
976,The soaring epicness of second part of the film and the excellent climax were tainted by bloated boring and technically terrible first half It had cringe dialogues poorly choreographed action scenes and unnecessary subplotsThe props used throughout the movie looked like cheap foam There was too much inspiration drawn from Hollywood moviesThe first attempt from Nag Ashwin is average at best I hope he improves significantly in the second part of this film To do so he should focus on Mahabharata and adapt it as faithfully as possible The scifi elements of the movie were most disappointing whereas the characters from the great epic were thoroughly exhilarating,positive
977,This is just a replica of Star wars movie The supream leader will look you like emperor palpatine Most of the technology and scene and army build up are already there in Star Wars Series So if you have watched lots of Hollywood movies you will not feel that you are watching this kind of movie first timeGood side is that Kalki is the first movie in Indian cinema which have this level of VFX which can completely give a better competition to any Hollywood science fiction moviesStory line of this movie could be much better but and its taken hour but only very few things we have experienced in the story,positive
978,I dont understand the obsession with hero entry and why people are not against it if you have a good story then just stick with why do you need the star to be bigger than the story first hour of story is skippable completely rest vfx was top notch even the ending was very good but this obsession with hero needs to stop also the director did not invent the character Kalki nor any references that they took from Mahabharata so please be respectful because its a part of our history not something that you can mock or not make it serious just because you want the hero entry or want films to have some useless and unfunny comedy,positive
979,I didnt go in with big hopes but i was expecting better than Adipurush this was way betterI watched it in IMAX Di dont know if there is d but there are no d shows in London There are lots of positives in this film and some negatives which could have been avoided and made it a better productNegativesIn the first half whenever Prabhas came on screen it was unbearable His intro scene was too far fetched unrelated to the story and unnecessaryAshwathammas young version of Amitabh is literally animated it was bad a decision to do that They casted so many cameos they couldve just casted Abhishek in that role and give Amitabhs voice overI expected the vfx to be not great in many parts and that is acceptable given the budgets But i think some choices still can be made to reduce the bad frames from the flim like reducing some scenes where the characters are doing extraordinary stunts nor does it look good and can easily replaced by a normal punch which atleast doesnt look badLuckily there are no dance numbers but one sequence where Prabhas and Disha are in the complex for work and they start looking around the complex are attending parties dancing etc for so long without even getting noticed I mean you need mil units to get into that place and it is a tough job have that many units but these guys are just fooling around there A context in how they could do that wouldve been great and given a better explanation to why Prabhas wants to go inPositivesThe vfx is on the better side while some of it being great Throughout the movie there is a consistency in good visuals with some patches of bad Overall happy with them and wish they improve in the second oneWorld building they have done is good character building is good and there a lots of small bits and pieces in the storyline which make it interesting watchAll main characters except Bhairava have been written well acted superbly and look magnificent but this movie is carried by Aswathamma I mean whenever he came on screen it felt goodLoved all the Mahabharat scenes They looked good were shot well and it was great to see our heros on bug screenPowerful end to the movie and I hope they dont take too long for the second partOverall a good movie and I want the makers to attempt such movies and keep improving so we can move towards the better product,positive
980,Its very tricky to do justice to a big story in time limits of a regular movie but this does have that balance in first released partGood Some key flashback context like combat bw arjun Karn were spot on Story is gripping Visuals are amazingThing that can be better Prabhas in first part maybe they could have gone with usual dubbing of Sharad kelkar in Hindi though time is given to build character in first half but apart from Amitabh Ji no one is able to justice to it and create connect that why first half seems boring at least in Hindi Action is there in st half as well but its some thing once might want to skip but in nd Half you dont want to miss itOverall its a good blend of Indian mythology with StarwarsScifi post apocalyptic movieWhat totally went over my head Prabhas transition from Kal Bhairava to Karna,positive
981,A unique genre a well written story script strong characters give this movie a strong start The extravagant visuals very detailed crisp VFX gives the audience much needed thrillHowever one cannot forgo the resemblance of some VFX shots have with movies like Dune Starwars mad max black panther transformersAlthough huge kudos to the team for producing a movie which is equivalent to the scale of above mentioned moviesPros Time taken to build characters explain world Stunts crisp bright visuals Screenplay Direction Comedy Cons Music background score is unique but doesnt give the much needed grandeur to the visuals and scenes repeated use of same score abruptly high background score during stunts Editing especially first half,neutral
982,Storyline Casting Second Half Sr AB Prabhass overacting VFX EDITING Over build up in Ist halfThe director was definitely inspired by Indian epic stories and rich historical texts But at the same side He was also influenced by Hollywood movies specifically released DUNE the theme of future AD and many more like Deepikas pregnancy the ship warhead like palace have been copied from it Now as the IInd installment of DUNE has already been released we will expect the war sequences in upcoming KAKLI part twoIm not criticizing the INDIAN movies but if you have such a stron storyline and good starcast then why you need cheeky methods just to attract masses I wish the director had maintained the seriousness of the subject that would have created an impact after the movie,positive
983,I just watched Kalki and its hard to express my disappointmentFirst off the movie is riddled with unnecessary comedic dialogues that feel completely out of place especially given the supposedly intense theme Prabhas who is usually a powerhouse sadly comes across as a CLOWNISH character hereHis performance is awkward and forced making it difficult to take the film seriously Kyras character adds little value with most of her screen time dedicated to pointless talks that drag the narrative down The entire movie feels like its overdoing everythingbe it the action sequences emotional moments or the supposed comedy which is jarringly out of sync with the rest of the movieKamal Haasan despite being a legendary actor has almost no role or screen presence It feels like they used his name just to draw audiences with no real contribution from him onscreenAdditionally the setup blatantly borrows from Mad Max Fury Road but fails miserably to capture the essence of the original In the end Kalki is a poorly executed overhyped messThis one is a hard pass,neutral
984,Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through cinematic chaos The story idea is an absolute gem brimming with potential and the characters are nothing short of a casting directors dreameach one brimming with pizzazz and personality But alas their development seems to have been left in the microwave a bit too long coming out halfbakedThe screenplay Its flatter than a weekold soda Though I must admit it does have its fizz in a few key moments like the interval and the climaxDialogues Lets just say they wont be winning any literary awardsNow onto the comedyits the kind that instead of tickling your funny bone it goes straight for the jugular and not in a good way The worldbuilding feels like it was put together with duct tape and imagination lacking the immersive magic we hoped forBut lets talk about the legendary Amitabh Bachchan who is stellar as alwaysPrabhas gives it his all bless his heartKamal Hassan makes a brief yet dazzling appearance hinting at more brilliance in the next instalmentSaswata Chatterjee He brings his Agame no doubt about itDeepika Padukone looks fine and delivers a decent performance and her Telugu dubbing is better than that in the trailerDisha Patani is scorching enough to set the screen on fire in her limited screen timeThe rest of the cast including Pashupati Shobhana and Rajendra Prasad put in decent efforts However the film is sprinkled with cameos like confetti at a surprise partymost of which are more of a headscratcher than a treatThe action scenes Theyre as disappointing as a soggy French fryCinematography is serviceable background music hits the right notes but the songs miss the markProduction values are respectable but direction sails somewhere in the middling seas of mediocritySome VFX are eyepoppingly good thoughOverall its a mixed bag of delights and letdownsa cinematic hotpot where the ingredients are only halfcooked Enjoy it for what it is but dont be surprised if you leave the theater feeling a little unsatisfied,positive
985,Over buildup music over acting by prabhas Amitabh bachchans acting is the only part of the film which deserve some appriciation fighting scenes of amitabh bachchan are very good where as prabhas do a very nice over acting in almost all of his scene And the over buildup music and forcefull emotions are also the worst part of this film It is a humble request to the director please dont smoke before shooting and make next part of this film watchable so that you dont have to over sell your movie next time And please tell prabhas not to make the next part unbearable as this oneConclusion over sold movie over buildup music and overaction by prabhas only AMITABH BACHCHANS character make the movie worthy,positive
986,Right off the bat I will say that the plot was superbly established it made you feel the stakes The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings Read on to find outI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotationsDialoguesNot much to say about these they are what you would expect from a scifi flick some hifi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi and the archaic style Hindi Sanksritised that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epicsCharactersI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava Bujji was almost nonexistent They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between themThe portrayal of Prabhas character got a bit tiresome at the start The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very very boring Apart from that he wasnt exactly a formidable force either and so wasnt AshwatthamaI genuinely feel that the creator didnt give any character the power that they deserved For instance Ashwatthamas powers are bound to the plot they only work in last resorts Bhairava does godlike damage as a human Other enemies are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumbThen the character of Deepika Padukone It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot so no complaints thereThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about nothing of that gravity as of the main charactersStory ExecutionThe start of the first half was stretched too much with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava intro fillers Then again his interactions with others were extremely dullThere were many continuity errors like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogetherApart from that the story pertaining to the Mahabharata was told superbly The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good so was his character You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movieSo in essence the plot was well planned out but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit shortVFXI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed At some parts the VFX was outstanding but in some places it was the exact opposite like the deaged AB looking like he came straight out of Motu PatluThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS with some scattered across the film I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps and the flying were very inorganic it was so cabley everyone was hovering around The film was really jump and flight heavy and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a Chiranjeevi involved enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping feet this shouldnt come as a surpriseCinematographyPretty standard nothing too extravagant Overall a solid setupMusicAn absolute treat to the ears I loved Ashwatthamas theme right from the announcement The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place but that just might be me Also maybe I am nitpicking too much now but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit Nevertheless the music complimented the scenes perfectlyInfluencesAs you know this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata I would say that the references to the epic and the scifi present day story were well balanced It all made sense and after all the essence is that of the Mahabharatas depictionIn conclusion the plot was extremely good story was told really well It however lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named Bhairava So the execution was a bit of a miss However even with its downsides the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments especially towards the end make this a worthwhile watch,positive
987,Jack of all and master of none Have used so many heros and directors for characters in movie its more of a spoof movie kind than serious movie Making is good but not the real story that is required Sci Fi movie without strong story making Skills Graphics are good Deepika has same expression from st scene to last scene in thr movie Bujji and Prabhas jokes doesnt jell so well as they expected to be linked in movie Movie length is too long more than hrs which makes audience to have good nap if show is night show I did the same so have mentioned it here I wish directors concentrate more on content not just on spending more money on movies,positive
988,Majestic at scale grandeur in VFX and great blend of scifi mythology taken at an eye popping level Proud moment indeed for Indian cinema that stands tall as a mega mountainDirector Nag Aswin takes us through three different never seen worlds First half is a bit drag with comedy elements and build up Editing could have been betterSecond half elevates to PEAKS with spectacular action sequences strong story and crisp screenplay Preinterval and climax is a hair riser and giving audience plenty of goosebumpsPrabhas is at his usual coolness and delivers Deepika Padukone emotes well and binds to her character Kamals getup and dialogue delivery will stun you There are plenty of surprises in terms of star castSir Amitabh Bachchan outweighs every other character and is the heart of the whole movie His stature voice caring attitude protective nature and breathtaking action scenes will be remembered by all agesTerrific BGM technical aspects and deeper mythological connection with a strong plot in second half will make audience go gagaTrue cinematic triumph and there will be a giant sea swell in the box office,positive
989,Synopsis Death is not a punishment it is a blessingFirst half The movie begins with themes and depictions that instantly immerse you However it falters in the middle due to pacing and editing issues Yet in the last minutes it regains its footing and delivers Prabhass best since bahubali The film also features numerous impressive cameosSecond half Oh my oh my The movie saves its best for last especially when delving into our history particularly the Mahabharata references Despite minor flaws Im inclined to overlook them because this film is truly special Director Ashwin has not only crafted a scifi film but a remarkable one especially given its budget constraintsAmitabh Bachchan stands out and Prabhas delivers a commendable performance The visuals are exceptional and serve as the films hallmark The background music is superb enriching and completing the cinematic experience However I would have preferred if it were utilized more extensively as it presents a slight missed opportunityFinal verdict Kalki is a splendid film not only in terms of its quality but also due to the directors visionary and honest approach to our history,neutral
990,Definitely worth watching in the theatre Great visuals good casting Gives the feel of Dune and Furiosa and AvengersOnly part I didnt personally like is the extremely repetitive and prolonged fights between Bhairava and Aswattama It couldve been way shorterLoved Bujjis character buildup reminds of Wall E VFX blends well doesnt feel like forced well doneBackground score couldve been better not very catchy and couldve elevated the mood betterThe part I enjoyed the most is climax the whole story build up comes to this and doesnt disappoint Excited about the next part cant wait to watch Kalki vs Kali with Karna,positive
991,Lets not compare this movie to any of the Hollywood sci fi movie When I watched kalki i felt a little unsatisfied coming out of the theatre reason for that is nag totally didnt give his best for the action scenes When it comes to visuals they did put the effort and considering the budget they were great The biggest downside of the movie is not being able to relate with bhairavaprotagonist overall personality and humour of bhairava felt underwhelming Amitabh bachchan is awesome as always his character felt so real and to me he felt more relatable than bhairava I Loved Mahabharata shots Every cast member gave their best to the actingLets not forget the fact that nag ashwin has taken a risk and made a sci fi genre movie in India with hindu mythological characters and prophecy nag has made a stepping stone for future sci fi movies of Indian cinema industry,positive
